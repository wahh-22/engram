# Contributing to Engram

Thanks for contributing. Engram enforces a strict **issue-first workflow** — every change starts with an approved issue.

---

## Contribution Workflow

```
Open Issue → Get status:approved → Open PR → Add type:* label → Review & Merge
```

### Step 1: Open an Issue

Use the correct template:
- **Bug Report** — for bugs
- **Feature Request** — for new features or improvements

> ⚠️ Blank issues are disabled. You must use a template.

Fill in all required fields. Your issue will automatically receive the `status:needs-review` label.

### Step 2: Wait for Approval

A maintainer will review the issue and add the `status:approved` label if it's accepted for implementation.

**Do not open a PR until the issue is approved.** Automated checks will block PRs that reference unapproved issues.

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

Once the issue is approved:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Implement your change
3. Open a PR using the PR template — **link the approved issue** with `Closes #N`
4. Add exactly **one `type:*` label** to the PR (see label system below)

### Step 4: Automated PR Checks

Required checks run automatically on every PR:

#### PR Validation

| Check | What it verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Check Issue Reference** | PR body contains `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, or `Resolves #N` |
| **Check Issue Has status:approved** | The linked issue has the `status:approved` label |
| **Check PR Has type:* Label** | PR has exactly one `type:*` label |

#### CI Tests

| Check | What it runs |
|-------|-------------|
| **Lint** | golangci-lint reports no new findings in Go changes |
| **Unit Tests** | `go test ./...` — all tests except those tagged with `//go:build e2e`; runs `make deadcode-check` to reject newly unreachable functions |
| **E2E Tests** | `go test -tags e2e ./internal/server/...` — end-to-end integration tests |

All required checks must pass before a PR can be merged.

> **Repo admin note:** Set these as required status checks in branch protection rules for `main`: `Lint`, `Unit Tests`, `E2E Tests`, `Plugin Tests`, and `PR Validation`.

### Quality Ratchets

Every PR and push to `main` runs `make deadcode-check`. It analyzes all module
packages with `golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode@v0.30.0` and compares stable
`file<TAB>symbol` identities with `.deadcode-baseline.txt`. New unreachable
functions fail CI. Removed entries pass and report that the debt tightened;
review and deliberately refresh the baseline with `make deadcode-baseline` in
the same change. Do not update a baseline merely to accept new debt.

### Performance Ratchet

Pushes to `main` compare the store search and scan benchmarks with the exact
previous `main` SHA from the push event on the same runner. This catches
statistically significant slowdowns greater than the configured threshold
without treating timing as a unit-test assertion.

Run `make perf-check` against the committed baseline on a matching local
configuration. To refresh that reviewed baseline deliberately after an accepted
performance tradeoff, run `make perf-baseline` and include the baseline change
with its justification. The baseline records its producing OS, architecture,
and CPU and is only comparable on a matching host configuration; it is not a
cross-host latency budget. CI instead compares the event's previous SHA and the
new revision on one runner.

For a repository's first main push, or when that previous revision has only a
strict subset of the current benchmark suite, CI enters an explicit bootstrap
mode. It verifies that the candidate benchmark names exactly match the versioned
baseline, then deliberately skips a cross-host timing comparison. Later pushes
must pair every benchmark from both revisions; an empty, renamed, partial, or
configuration-split comparison fails.

### Lint Ratchet

CI runs golangci-lint v2.13.2 with the `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, and `unused`
linters. It reports only findings introduced by the pull request or the pushed
main revision, so existing debt does not block adoption while new debt fails
the check. Install golangci-lint v2.13.2 locally and run `make lint` before
pushing; the target requires that exact version on `PATH` and fails before
linting if it is missing or different. It reports findings in staged, unstaged,
untracked, and latest committed changes compared with `HEAD~`.

## Label System

### Type Labels (required on every PR — pick exactly one)

| Label | Color | Use for |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `type:bug` | 🔴 | Bug fixes |
| `type:feature` | 🔵 | New features |
| `type:docs` | 🔵 | Documentation-only changes |
| `type:refactor` | 🟣 | Code refactoring with no behavior change |
| `type:chore` | ⚪ | Maintenance, tooling, dependencies |
| `type:breaking-change` | 🔴 | Breaking changes (requires major version bump) |

### Status Labels (set by maintainers)

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `status:needs-review` | Awaiting maintainer review (auto-applied to new issues) |
| `status:approved` | Approved for implementation — PRs can now be opened |
| `status:in-progress` | Actively being worked on — auto-exempt from stale bot |
| `status:blocked` | Blocked by another issue or external dependency |
| `status:stale` | No activity for 30 days — auto-applied by stale bot |
| `status:wontfix` | Intentionally not fixing — applied when closing stale/rejected items |

### Priority Labels (set by maintainers)

`priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`

> Issues with `priority:high` and `status:approved` are never auto-closed by the stale bot.

### Effort Labels (set by maintainers, for contributor guidance)

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `effort:small` | < 1 hour — good starting point for new contributors |
| `effort:medium` | 1–4 hours |
| `effort:large` | > 4 hours or spans multiple files |

## PR Rules

- Keep PR scope focused — one logical change per PR
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing:
  - Unit: `go test ./...`
  - E2E: `go test -tags e2e ./internal/server/...`
  - Lint: `make lint` (requires golangci-lint v2.13.2)
- Update docs in the same PR when behavior changes
- Do not reference endpoints/scripts that do not exist in code
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commits

### Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Examples:**

```
feat(cli): add --json flag to session list command

fix(store): prevent duplicate observation insert on retry

docs(contributing): add label system documentation

refactor(internal): extract search query sanitizer

chore(deps): bump github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea to v0.26

fix!: change session ID format (breaking change)
BREAKING CHANGE: session IDs are now UUIDs instead of integers
```

Types map to labels: `feat` → `type:feature`, `fix` → `type:bug`, `docs` → `type:docs`, `refactor` → `type:refactor`, `chore` → `type:chore`.

## npm Dependency Hygiene

When adding npm dependencies to `plugin/pi` or `plugin/obsidian`:

### Use `npq` for inspection

Install once:

```bash
npm i -g npq
```

Then install new deps via:

```bash
npq install <package>
```

`npq` runs pre-flight checks (typosquats, install scripts, known vulns) before delegating to npm.

### Honor the `.npmrc` defaults

The repo `.npmrc` enforces:

- `ignore-scripts=true` — third-party lifecycle scripts do NOT run on install
- `allow-git=none` — git URLs as deps are rejected
- `min-release-age=3` — packages newer than 3 days old are rejected

If you have a legitimate reason to override these for local dev (e.g. `esbuild` postinstall), use a flag for that specific command — DO NOT edit `.npmrc`:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts=false esbuild
```

### Consult Snyk before merging

For every new dep added in a PR, paste the Snyk Advisor link in the PR description:

```
https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/<name>
```

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#vetting-new-dependencies) for the maintainer-side vetting checklist (provenance, transitive deps, install scripts).

## Skill Authoring Standard

Repository skills live in `skills/`.

Use a **hybrid format**:

1. Structured base (purpose, when to use, critical rules, checklists)
2. Cookbook section (`If / Then / Example`) for repetitive actions

Why hybrid:
- Structured base protects correctness and architecture intent
- Cookbook improves execution consistency for common flows

## Maintainer Triage Cadence

Engram uses a lightweight, regular cadence so contributors know what to expect.

| Activity | Frequency | What Happens |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| New issue triage | Within 2 days | Maintainer labels + approves or closes |
| PR review | Within 7 days | Maintainer reviews + requests changes or merges |
| Backlog sweep | Weekly (Monday) | Stale bot runs; approved/blocked issues reassessed |
| Label audit | Monthly | Orphan labels removed; accuracy check |
| Dependabot PRs | Weekly | Review merged or deferred |

If you haven't received a response within 7 days on a PR or issue, a single ping comment is welcome.

---

## What Gets Closed Without Merging

- PRs opened without an approved issue
- PRs that fail CI and aren't updated within 30 days
- Issues that are vague, a duplicate, or belong in [Discussions](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram/discussions)
- Issues with no response to a maintainer question after 14 days

---

## Agent Skill Linking

Run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This links repo `skills/*` into project-local:
- `.claude/skills/*`
- `.codex/skills/*`
- `.gemini/skills/*`
