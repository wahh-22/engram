## 📝 Summary

<!-- What does this PR do? Be concise — 1-3 bullet points. -->

## 📂 Changes

<!-- Key files changed and what was modified in each. -->

| File | Change |

## 🧪 Test Plan

<!-- Record actual commands and outcomes, not assumed passes. For behavior changes, run a focused regression and affected package tests locally. For docs-only changes, mark Go tests N/A and list documentation checks. Targeted coverage is informative, not a total module coverage or per-PR numeric gate. Without a PR (or before pushing), and for high-risk changes, run additional applicable local checks and report missing CI evidence. -->

- [ ] Focused regression (behavior change): `<actual command>` — `<outcome or N/A: documentation-only>`
- [ ] Affected package tests (behavior change): `<actual command>` — `<outcome or N/A: documentation-only>`
- [ ] Other applicable local checks (including documentation/manual checks): `<actual command or steps>` — `<outcome or N/A with reason>`

<!-- Describe any manual testing steps and checks that could not run: -->

## 🤖 Automated Checks

After pushing/opening the PR, GitHub CI runs the broad unit/E2E/lint and applicable platform checks. These automated statuses remain pending until the actual checks run; do not claim a pass from local evidence. Windows checks run for PRs but not merge groups, and are not among the six required contexts. Lint and Check PR Has No Transient Artifacts also run for PRs but are not required contexts; Lint also runs on pushes to main. All required checks must pass before merge:

| Check | What it verifies | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Check Issue Reference** | PR body contains `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` | ⏳ |
| **Check Issue Has status:approved** | Linked issue has `status:approved` label | ⏳ |
| **Check PR Has type:* Label** | Canonical labels, applicability, and cardinality | ⏳ |
| **Check PR Has No Transient Artifacts** | PR files comply with the [Transient Artifact Policy](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#transient-artifact-policy) | ⏳ |
| **Unit Tests** | `go test ./...` passes | ⏳ |
| **E2E Tests** | `go test -tags e2e ./internal/server/...` passes | ⏳ |
| **Plugin Tests** | `npm test` passes in `plugin/pi` | ⏳ |
| **Lint** | golangci-lint reports no new findings | ⏳ |
| **Windows Setup Test** | Windows setup preserves absolute paths and MCP job-object parent-lifetime tests pass | ⏳ |
| **Cloud Sync Wrapper Tests (Windows)** | Cloud sync wrapper and missing-PowerShell-Engram tests pass on Windows | ⏳ |
