## Engram Persistent Memory — ACTIVE PROTOCOL

You have engram memory tools. This protocol is MANDATORY and ALWAYS ACTIVE.

### CORE TOOLS — always available, no ToolSearch needed
mem_save, mem_search, mem_context, mem_session_summary, mem_get_observation, mem_save_prompt, mem_current_project, mem_judge, mem_compare

Use ToolSearch for other tools: mem_update, mem_review, mem_pin, mem_unpin, mem_suggest_topic_key, mem_session_start, mem_session_end, mem_doctor, mem_capture_passive

### PROACTIVE SAVE — do NOT wait for user to ask
Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY after ANY of these:
- Decision made (architecture, convention, workflow, tool choice)
- Bug fixed (include root cause)
- Convention or workflow documented/updated
- Notion/Jira/GitHub artifact created or updated with significant content
- Non-obvious discovery, gotcha, or edge case found
- Pattern established (naming, structure, approach)
- User preference or constraint learned
- Feature implemented with non-obvious approach

**Self-check after EVERY task**: "Did I just make a decision, fix a bug, learn something, or establish a convention? If yes → mem_save NOW."

### DELIVERY GUARANTEE
Memory operations are internal bookkeeping, never the user-facing answer. Complete required memory work before composing the completed-task reply; send the complete answer as the final message of the turn with no later tool calls. If memory work fails or needs follow-up, still send the answer.

### SEARCH MEMORY when:
- User asks to recall anything ("remember", "what did we do", or the equivalent in the user's language)
- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- User mentions a topic you have no context on

### SESSION CLOSE — before saying "done":
Call `mem_session_summary` with: Goal, Discoveries, Accomplished, Next Steps, Relevant Files.

# Unconditional lead-in for the numbered recovery steps below — this is the
# compaction-recovery contract itself, not duplicated protocol prose, so it
# stays outside the $mode gate even when the static protocol text is slim.
echo "CRITICAL INSTRUCTION POST-COMPACTION — follow these steps IN ORDER:"

printf "\n1. FIRST: Call mem_session_summary with the content of the compacted summary above. Use project: '%s'.\n" "$PROJECT"
printf "   This preserves what was accomplished before compaction.\n\n"
printf "2. THEN: Call mem_context with project: '%s' to recover recent session history and observations.\n" "$PROJECT"
printf "   Read the returned context carefully — it tells you what was being worked on.\n\n"
cat <<'PROTOCOL'
3. If you need more detail on a specific topic, call mem_search with relevant keywords.

4. Only THEN continue working on what the user asked.

All 4 steps are MANDATORY. Without them, you lose context and start blind.
