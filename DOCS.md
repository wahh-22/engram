## Documentation Authority

When documentation and code disagree, this table says which doc surface is canonical for each contract, where the code-level authority lives, and which sibling docs must change together with it.

Reader and status guide:

- [README.md](README.md) is the concise product overview; this living `DOCS.md` is the full technical reference. Maintainer and contributor guides explain how to work with the system rather than replacing the contract-specific authorities below; the [Codebase Guide](docs/CODEBASE-GUIDE.md) covers ownership and guardrails.
- These living docs are maintained and checked against shipped code and tests, not presumed to be generated copies. A historical record does not supersede shipped behavior or its tests. Generation is claimed only where a source-to-copy path is verified below.
- [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) assigns the default reviewer/owner `@Gentleman-Programming` to paths without a more specific match, including these docs; review ownership does not make every document canonical.

| Contract                               | Canonical doc surface               | Code authority                                                               | Must change together                                                                                                                       |

Code and tests beat docs: `internal/mcp` owns agent-facing tool schemas, `internal/store` owns the durable schema, `internal/setup` owns install surfaces, and `plugin/*` translates host events without duplicating durable policy.

### Reading and updating the memory protocol

For readers, [Memory Protocol](#memory-protocol-full-text) is the canonical living agent-facing prose contract. The table above names related surfaces to check when that behavior changes; "must change together" means review for behavioral alignment, not copy identical text into every host.

For maintainers, distinguish these ownership paths:

- `internal/setup/setup.go` maintains `memoryProtocolMarkdown` independently. Setup uses that embedded text for installed agent instructions; it is not generated from DOCS.md. Compare behavior when editing either prose surface.
- `skills/memory-protocol/SKILL.md` is a manually maintained contributor skill. `plugin/claude-code/skills/memory/SKILL.md` and `plugin/codex/skills/memory/SKILL.md` are host-adapted, manually maintained skills. Consider their relevant instructions alongside the canonical prose rather than assuming byte identity or automatic sync.
- `plugin/opencode/engram.ts` contains OpenCode's agent instructions. Its verified generated copy is `internal/setup/plugins/opencode/engram.ts`: `go generate ./internal/setup/` copies source to embedded destination, and `TestEmbeddedOpenCodePluginMatchesSourceByteForByte` checks equality. This generation direction applies to the OpenCode plugin copy, not the other prose and skill surfaces above.

### Documentation surface catalog

This catalog covers the 60 tracked Markdown files. **Owner `GP`** means CODEOWNERS review routing to `@Gentleman-Programming`, not an individual author or content owner. **Canonical** identifies a contract named in the matrix above; **guide** explains or operates alongside contracts; **instruction** directs agents; **policy/template** governs contribution or reuse. **Living** means maintained against current behavior, not a guarantee that every described optional feature is enabled. Beta material describes experimental paths, not universally shipped behavior.

The memory protocol's canonical prose is [Memory Protocol](#memory-protocol-full-text); `internal/setup/setup.go` independently maintains `memoryProtocolMarkdown` for installed generated instructions. Claude and Codex plugin skill files above are manually maintained. OpenCode's source `plugin/opencode/engram.ts` has a verified generated embedded copy at `internal/setup/plugins/opencode/engram.ts`; neither is a separate Markdown catalog entry. Historical OpenSpec/SDD changes are transient, non-shipped records, not evidence of current behavior.

## Database Schema

### Tables

The live schema is created and incrementally migrated by `Store.migrate` in [`internal/store/store.go`](internal/store/store.go); treat that migration as the source of authority when this summary and the database differ.

- **sessions** — `id` (TEXT PK), `project`, `ownership_mode`, `directory`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `summary`, `runtime_lease_expires_at` (local-only runtime liveness; never synced or exported)
- **observations** — `id` (INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT), `sync_id`, `session_id` (FK), `type`, `title`, `content`, `tool_name`, `project`, `scope`, `topic_key`, `normalized_hash`, `revision_count`, `duplicate_count`, `last_seen_at`, `pinned`, `review_after`, `expires_at`, `embedding`, `embedding_model`, `embedding_created_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- **observations_fts** — FTS5 virtual table synced via triggers (`title`, `content`, `tool_name`, `type`, `project`, `topic_key`)
- **user_prompts** — `id` (INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT), `sync_id`, `session_id` (FK), `content`, `project`, `created_at`; **prompt_tombstones** records deleted prompt `sync_id`, `session_id`, `project`, and `deleted_at`
- **prompts_fts** — FTS5 virtual table synced via triggers (`content`, `project`)
- **sync_chunks** — `target_key` (TEXT), `chunk_id` (TEXT), `imported_at`; composite PK (`target_key`, `chunk_id`) for target-scoped chunk tracking
- **sync_state** — one row per `target_key`, with lifecycle, sequence, retry/backoff, lease, error, success, and update metadata; **sync_mutations** — ordered mutation queue with target, project, entity, operation, payload, source, acknowledgement, and disposition metadata
- **sync_delete_tombstones** — one row per deleted entity (PK `entity`, `entity_key`) with `session_id`, `project`, `deleted_at`, `hard_delete`, `active`, `last_mutation_seq`, and `last_remote_mutation_seq` metadata. `last_mutation_seq` retains the highest historical local delete-mutation sequence; backfill emits missing delete intent for active tombstones without a recorded remote delete sequence or matching unacknowledged delete mutation, without advancing that field. `last_remote_mutation_seq` records the default cloud target's remote delete floor. Pulled session and observation upserts first pass a tombstone guard: local sync compares a known payload generation with the hard-delete time, while cloud sync checks the applicable remote delete sequence floor. Without its own floor, an active tombstone blocks the default target; for non-default targets, it blocks only when no non-default target has a remote floor. Only permitted upserts can deactivate the tombstone.
- **sync_delete_tombstone_remote_floors** — per-non-default-cloud-target delete floors, keyed by (`target_key`, `entity`, `entity_key`), with `last_mutation_seq` storing the highest recorded remote delete sequence for that target and entity.
- **sync_enrolled_projects** — enrolled project and enrollment timestamp; **cloud_upgrade_state** — per-project upgrade stage, repair class, snapshot, findings, actions, error, and update metadata
- **memory_relations** — stores conflict-surfacing verdicts from `mem_judge`; columns include `id` (INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT), `sync_id` (TEXT UNIQUE), `source_id`, `target_id`, `relation`, `judgment_status` (`pending` | `judged` | `orphaned` | `ignored`), provenance, supersession, and timestamp metadata. The SQLite table does not store a `project` column; project is carried in relation sync payloads and derived from joined observations for project-scoped listing. Syncs across machines via local chunks and via cloud autosync when the project is enrolled.
- **sync_apply_deferred** — holds pulled mutations that could not be applied locally due to a missing FK dependency (e.g. relation references an observation not yet present), including target, remote sequence, entity, operation, project, scope, retry, status, and error metadata. Rows with `apply_status='dead'` have exceeded the retry cap (5 attempts) and will not be retried automatically.

### SQLite Configuration

- WAL mode for concurrent reads
- Busy timeout 5000ms
- Synchronous NORMAL
- Foreign keys ON

### Data-directory filesystem safety

Persistent SQLite WAL is unsafe on network filesystems. Engram rejects known NFS and SMB/CIFS data directories before it opens, migrates, or changes the database files. An unknown filesystem remains compatible, but is not a proof that the directory is local.

If startup reports a network filesystem, stop **all** Engram processes, then copy the complete `engram.db`, `engram.db-wal`, and `engram.db-shm` triplet together to local storage. Set `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR` to the absolute path of that local directory (relative paths are rejected), start Engram, and run `engram doctor`. Then run the integrity check for your shell:

```bash
# POSIX shell or Git Bash
sqlite3 "$ENGRAM_DATA_DIR/engram.db" "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
sqlite3 (Join-Path $env:ENGRAM_DATA_DIR 'engram.db') 'PRAGMA integrity_check;'
```

Engram does not auto-repair, quarantine, checkpoint, or fall back to rollback journaling for this condition.

engram obsidian-export        Export memories to Obsidian (beta; --all for every project)
engram version                Show version
```

For `setup [agent]`, see [Agent Setup](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md) for supported integrations rather than treating a fixed agent list as exhaustive. `--all` deliberately selects every project for applicable reads and local sync export (cloud sync still requires a single project); do not combine it with an explicit project. `engram context [project]` accepts the positional project as an alternative to `--project`. `projects prune --paths-only` limits candidates to names containing `/` or `\`.

Cloud commands include `cloud status`, `cloud config --server <url>`, `cloud enroll <project>`, `cloud unenroll <project>`, and `cloud serve`. For upgrades, use `cloud upgrade <doctor|repair|bootstrap|remirror|status|rollback> --project <name>`; `remirror` rebuilds cloud state from authoritative local data. Server-side repair uses `cloud repair materialize-mutations --project <project> (--dry-run|--apply)`. Managed-admin setup uses `cloud bootstrap admin --username <name> [--email <email>] [--grant-project <project>]... [--issue-token [name]]`; stranded-admin token recovery uses `cloud bootstrap recover-token [--name <name>] [--revoke-existing]`. See [Cloud CLI](#cloud-cli-opt-in) and [managed-user bootstrap](#managed-users-tokens-and-cli-bootstrap) for constraints and detailed syntax.

## HTTP API Endpoints

### Project-scoped read migration

Project-aware reads resolve an omitted project to the canonical current project: explicit `project`, then `ENGRAM_PROJECT`, then cwd detection. To read across every project, pass `all_projects=true`; do not combine it with `project`. CLI counterparts use `--all`. This intentionally replaces formerly implicit-global behavior for recent lists, review, prompts, export, stats, and conflict inspection. `GET /sync/status` resolves and validates one current or explicit project but rejects `all_projects=true` because its provider cannot aggregate project status.

Engram exposes two different runtimes. Keep routes split by runtime:

- **Local runtime (`engram serve`, JSON on `127.0.0.1:7437` by default, or a POSIX Unix socket when selected)**
  - `GET /health` (local service health)
  - includes memory CRUD/search/context endpoints documented below
  - includes `GET /sync/status` (local node sync status)
- **Cloud runtime (`engram cloud serve`)**
  - `GET /health` (cloud service health)
  - `GET /sync/pull`, `GET /sync/pull/{chunkID}`, `POST /sync/push`, `POST /sync/mutations/push`, `GET /sync/mutations/pull` (cloud sync transport)
  - `POST /sync/session-authorities` registers a session explicitly with JSON `session_id` and owner `project`.
    Managed principals need a project grant; legacy authenticated tokens use the configured allowlist.
    Grant normalization does not change the stored owner: a grant for `alpha-foo` can authorize `alpha/foo`, whose owner remains `alpha/foo`.
    In insecure no-auth mode registration returns 401 without writing; oversized JSON returns 413.
    Chunks and imported sessions never bootstrap registration: an imported/offline session needs deliberate reauthorization.
    Matching owner replay returns 200; conflicting owner returns 409. Registration alone does not authorize prompt claims or deletes.
  - `POST /sync/prompt-pair-claims` requires a bearer token and JSON `session_id`, `source_inbox_id`, `sync_id`, `owner_project`, and `project` (prompt storage project).
    `owner_project` is an authorization selector, **not** authority: the server checks grants/legacy allowlist for both projects before looking up the independently registered session, then requires its stored owner to match the selector. Grant aliases do not rewrite stored project identity.
    Missing registration, owner mismatch, and authority disappearance during claim all return the same generic 404 JSON body with `error_code: session_authority_unavailable`; an absent old-server route returns a 404 without that code. Matching claim replay returns 200, competing pair binding 409. Invalid JSON/unknown fields return 400, oversized bodies 413, and insecure no-auth mode 401.
    `MutationTransport.RegisterSessionAuthority` and `ClaimPromptPair` can POST these JSON requests over the configured transport; non-200 responses are errors, with an absent old-server route classified as `server_unsupported`. Autosync does not invoke these methods yet. Clients must explicitly register the session under its owner and claim the pair under dual authorization before relying on remote pair provenance. Delete enforcement and the client handshake/pending retry path are not implemented yet; this route alone does not make unverified deletes safe.
  - `GET /dashboard/*` HTML routes (browser dashboard)

Dashboard route tree (`engram cloud serve`):

- Public
  - `GET /dashboard/health` — dashboard subsystem health
  - `GET /dashboard/login` — login surface (authenticated mode), redirects to `/dashboard/` when already authenticated
  - `POST /dashboard/login` — login submit (authenticated mode), redirect-only no-op in insecure mode
  - `POST /dashboard/logout` — clear session cookie and redirect to login
  - `GET /dashboard/static/*` — embedded CSS/JS assets
- Protected (requires dashboard session in authenticated mode; open in insecure mode)
  - `GET /dashboard` and `GET /dashboard/` — dashboard overview
  - `GET /dashboard/stats`
  - `GET /dashboard/activity`
  - `GET /dashboard/browser`
  - `GET /dashboard/browser/observations` (`HX-Request: true` returns fragment; plain GET returns full page)
  - `GET /dashboard/browser/sessions` (`HX-Request: true` returns fragment; plain GET returns full page)
  - `GET /dashboard/browser/sessions/{sessionID}`
  - `GET /dashboard/browser/prompts` (`HX-Request: true` returns fragment; plain GET returns full page)
  - `GET /dashboard/projects`
  - `GET /dashboard/projects/list` — HTMX partial; paginated project list with "Paused" badges
  - `GET /dashboard/projects/{project}`
  - `GET /dashboard/projects/{name}/observations` — HTMX partial for project detail
  - `GET /dashboard/projects/{name}/sessions` — HTMX partial for project detail
  - `GET /dashboard/projects/{name}/prompts` — HTMX partial for project detail
  - `GET /dashboard/contributors`
  - `GET /dashboard/contributors/list` — HTMX partial; paginated contributor list
  - `GET /dashboard/contributors/{contributor}`
  - `GET /dashboard/admin` (also requires admin token/session)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/projects`
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/users` (admin-gated)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/users/list` (admin-gated; HTMX partial)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}` (admin-gated; managed-user detail)
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users` — create managed user
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}/enable` — enable managed user
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}/disable` — disable managed user
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}/tokens` — create managed token
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/tokens/{tokenID}/revoke` — revoke managed token
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}/grants` — create project grant
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/users/{principalID}/grants/{project}/revoke` — revoke project grant
  - Managed-user detail and form routes use the dashboard session, unlike the JSON `/admin/*` API. Viewing detail allows dashboard admin sessions; mutations require managed-admin permission. Successful form mutations redirect (303, or `HX-Redirect` for HTMX), except token creation, which renders the show-once token directly without redirecting.
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/health` (admin-gated)
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/projects/{name}/sync` (admin-gated; toggle sync enabled/disabled)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/projects/{name}/sync/form` (admin-gated; HTMX partial)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/audit-log` (admin-gated)
  - `GET /dashboard/admin/audit-log/list` (admin-gated; HTMX partial)
  - `GET /dashboard/sessions/{project}/{sessionID}` — session detail with observations + prompts sub-lists
  - `GET /dashboard/observations/{project}/{sessionID}/{syncID}` — observation detail
  - `GET /dashboard/prompts/{project}/{sessionID}/{syncID}` — prompt detail

Dashboard bootstrap/recovery (separate from Public and Protected routes):

- `GET /dashboard/bootstrap` — show the first managed-admin creation form.
- `POST /dashboard/bootstrap` — create the first managed admin; rejects creation when an active admin already exists.

Both routes require legacy dashboard recovery access. In authenticated mode, this means a valid dashboard session for the configured legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` principal; managed admins and members cannot use these routes. In insecure mode, bypassing the dashboard session check does not supply a `LegacyEnvAdmin` principal, so the bootstrap handlers are not generally open.

Engram is local-first: local SQLite is authoritative; cloud features are optional replication/shared access and enrollment controls.

### Mutation materialization attribution

For an accepted `POST /sync/mutations/push`, each future materialized cloud chunk records the authenticated server principal's display name. If it is blank, the server uses the principal ID, then `unknown`. The mutation-envelope `created_by` value cannot control accepted chunk attribution. This is distinct from explicit `POST /sync/push`, which preserves its chunk `created_by` metadata. Existing cloud rows are not repaired or rewritten by this behavior.

### Health

- Local runtime (`engram serve`): `GET /health` checks the local store with live aggregate queries. On success it returns `200` with `{"status":"ok","service":"engram","version":"<release version>","instance_id":"<store instance ID>","capabilities":{"isolated_session_registration":true}}`; a failed store returns `500` with `{"error":"health check failed"}` instead of reporting healthy.
- Cloud runtime (`engram cloud serve`): `GET /health` — Returns `{"status": "ok", "service": "engram-cloud"}`

### Sessions

- `POST /sessions` — Create or renew a runtime session. Body: `{id, project, directory?, ownership_mode?, resume?, isolated?}`
  - `directory` is optional. Ordinary registration normalizes directories to the runtime worktree root, including omitted or blank input resolving to server cwd. Renewal keeps the first nonblank stored directory.
  - `isolated: true` requires `ownership_mode: "project_owned"` and an omitted or blank directory (otherwise `400`). It stores an empty directory and atomically rejects a nonblank directory on either the requested root or selected continuation with `409 code: "session_isolation_conflict"` before lease renewal, ownership repair, or sync mutations. Existing runtime-bound rows are never silently cleared. This contract is advertised by `GET /health` as `capabilities.isolated_session_registration: true`; clients must require that exact capability before sending isolated registrations, because older servers may ignore the flag.
  - `ownership_mode` accepts `shared` or `project_owned`; when omitted it defaults to `shared`.
  - A successful create or renewal writes a local 30-minute `runtime_lease_expires_at` without changing the persisted session identity. Leases are local liveness evidence only: they are neither synced nor exported.
  - A `project_owned` registration cannot reuse a session with a nonblank persisted project different from its requested project. It returns `409` with `{error, code:"session_project_conflict", session_id, owner_project, requested_project}` and does not mutate the session or local sync journal. Same-project registration remains idempotent; omitted or `shared` registration retains compatibility for shared sessions.
  - `resume` is an optional boolean, default `false`. Without it, an ended session returns `409` with `code: "session_already_ended"`; ended rows are never reopened. `POST /sessions/{id}/end` remains the endpoint that sets `ended_at`.
  - With `resume: true`, a new or live root keeps its ID. For an ended root, the store atomically renews the lowest numeric live `<id>:resume:N` continuation, or creates the next ordinal after the maximum existing numeric suffix (starting at 2, no cap). Non-numeric suffixes and other roots are ignored. The selected continuation follows normal ownership and lease rules; conflicts return `409 session_project_conflict` without advancing further. Concurrent callers converge on one live continuation.
  - Success remains `201` with `{id, status:"created"}`. A continuation response also includes `resumed_from: <root id>` and returns the effective ID in `id`. Use that acknowledged ID for subsequent session-bound operations. MCP session registration does not opt into resume mode.
  - An invalid non-empty `ownership_mode` returns `400` and does not create a session.
  - Session IDs are opaque non-blank strings. The Pi adapter derives cross-project satellite IDs as `<runtimeID>@<project>` (registered `project_owned` with `resume: true`, `isolated: true`, and no directory). Capability preflight protects against old servers without a guessed version floor. Newly created satellites are never implicit directory-matched runtime candidates; Pi's explicit `cwd` only resolves the target project. This ensures an explicitly targeted write to another project never re-registers the runtime session under a second owner. See [plugin/pi/README.md](plugin/pi/README.md#cross-project-saves).
- `POST /sessions/{id}/end` — End session. Body: `{summary}`
- `GET /sessions/recent` — Recent sessions. Query: `?project=X&all_projects=true&limit=N`
  - No-result responses return `200` with `[]` (never `null`)
- `GET /sessions/{id}` — Get single session by ID
- `DELETE /sessions/{id}` — Delete session
  - `200` when deleted
  - `404` when session does not exist
  - `409` when session still has observations (delete/migrate observations first)
  - For cloud-enrolled projects: returns `200` and additionally enqueues a `session/delete` mutation that propagates the deletion to cloud replicas

### Observations

- `POST /observations` — Add observation. Body: `{session_id, type, title, content, tool_name?, project?, scope?, topic_key?}`
  - `400` when `title` or `content` is missing, empty, or whitespace-only. The observation-create paths (`engram save`, `mem_save`, `POST /observations`) enforce the same title rule because cloud sync rejects observation upserts without a title, and one rejected mutation blocks every later mutation for the project
- `GET /observations` — Recent observations compatibility endpoint. Query: `?project=X&all_projects=true&scope=project|personal|global&limit=N&sort=created_at:desc`
- `GET /observations/recent` — Recent observations. Query: `?project=X&all_projects=true&scope=project|personal|global&limit=N`
  - No-result responses from both observation collection endpoints return `200` with `[]` (never `null`)
- `GET /observations/{id}` — Get single observation by ID
- `PATCH /observations/{id}?expected_project=X` — Update fields. Body: `{title?, content?, find?, replace?, type?, project?, scope?, topic_key?}`
  - `find` and `replace` must be supplied together and cannot be combined with `content`. They perform a literal, case-sensitive, global replacement inside the existing observation; empty `find`, no match, or normalized-identical output leaves content unchanged.
  - Each replacement input and the transformed result are bounded by the configured observation content limit. `400` is returned for invalid pairs, content conflicts, bounds failures, or title/content validation failures; missing observations return `404`.
- `PUT /observations/{id}/pin` — Pin an observation on this device. Returns `{id, pinned: true}`.
- `DELETE /observations/{id}/pin` — Unpin an observation on this device. Returns `{id, pinned: false}`.
  - Both pin routes are idempotent, return `400` for an invalid ID, and return `404` when the observation does not exist
  - Pin state is local-only for sync: these routes do not change `updated_at` or enqueue sync work. Direct backups preserve pin state, but shared sync payloads continue to omit it.
- `DELETE /observations/{id}?expected_project=X` — Delete observation (`&hard=true` for hard delete, soft delete by default)
  - `200` when deleted
  - `404` when observation does not exist
  - Both PATCH and DELETE require an explicit `expected_project` owner assertion: missing, blank, or invalid names return `400`; normalized owner mismatch or immutable project reassignment through PATCH returns `409` without changing the observation, revision, or sync queue. Personal/global scopes do not bypass ownership. The assertion and mutation run in one store transaction; project metadata remains immutable.
- `POST /topic-keys/suggest` — Suggest a stable topic key using the same heuristic as `mem_suggest_topic_key`. Body: `{type?, title?, content?}`. Returns `{topic_key}`.
  - At least one of `title` or `content` must be non-empty; invalid JSON or missing suggestion input returns `400`

### Review

- `GET /review` — List observations due for local review. Query: `?project=X&all_projects=true&limit=N`
- `POST /review/mark_reviewed` — Reset one observation's local review cycle. Body: `{observation_id}`; legacy `{id}` is accepted.
  - `200` with the refreshed observation payload when marked reviewed
  - `400` when `observation_id`/`id` is missing or the JSON body is invalid
  - `404` when the observation does not exist
  - Local-only: updating `review_after` does not enqueue a sync mutation or propagate to other machines.

### Search

- `GET /search` — FTS5 search. Query: `?q=QUERY&type=TYPE&project=PROJECT&scope=SCOPE&limit=N`
  - `200` with a JSON array of search results
  - No-result example: `GET /search?q=definitely-no-hit` returns `200` with `[]` (never `null`)

### Timeline

- `GET /timeline` — Chronological context. Query: `?observation_id=N&before=5&after=5`

### Prompts

- `POST /prompts` — Save user prompt. Body: `{session_id, content, project?}`
- `GET /prompts/recent` — Recent prompts. Query: `?project=X&all_projects=true&limit=N`
- `GET /prompts/search` — Search prompts. Query: `?q=QUERY&project=X&all_projects=true&limit=N`
  - No-result responses from both prompt collection endpoints return `200` with `[]` (never `null`)
- `DELETE /prompts/{id}` — Delete prompt
  - `200` when deleted
  - `400` for invalid prompt id
  - `404` when prompt does not exist

### Context

- `GET /context` — Manual formatted context scoped by project and optional scope. Query: `?project=X&scope=project|personal|global&observations=N&prompts=N&sessions=N&pinned=N&compact=BOOL&max_bytes=N`
  - `observations`/`prompts`/`sessions`/`pinned`: `0` (or omitted/invalid) uses that section's legacy default, `>0` caps it (silently clamped to a `500` ceiling), `<0` omits the section and its `### ...` header entirely
  - `compact=true` drops the inline content preview from `Pinned`/`Recent Observations` bullets, keeping just `- [type] **title**`
  - `max_bytes`: `0`, omitted, invalid, or negative preserves the unbounded legacy output; a positive value caps the complete rendered context at that many bytes (silently clamped to `65536`). Truncation is UTF-8-safe and appends a `[truncated]` marker when it fits within the requested budget.
  - Invalid or unparseable values silently fall back to their default — never a `400`
- `GET /context/compaction` — Runtime compaction context scoped strictly to one persisted session. Query: `?session_id=X`. The server derives the session project; this endpoint does not accept project or scope selection.

### Passive Capture

- `POST /observations/passive` — Scan submitted text and persist only structured learnings recognized by the parser. Body: `{content, session_id, project?, source?}`. General or raw text is not saved as an observation.

### Export / Import

- `GET /export` — Export current-project data as a versioned JSON backup
  - Optional `?project=<name>` selects a known project; `?all_projects=true` exports every project
  - Current format `0.2.0` preserves observations (including local pin state), prompts, and complete memory-relation judgment and supersession metadata.
  - `400` for blank, malformed, or conflicting selectors
- `POST /import` — Import one JSON backup atomically. Current `0.2.0` backups and legacy `0.1.0` backups that omit pins and relations are accepted; unsupported versions are rejected before mutation. Relations normally require both endpoint observations in the resulting store. Audit rows whose normalized `judgment_status` is exactly `orphaned` may retain missing source and/or target observations; their IDs and metadata are preserved. All other dangling relations and missing superseding relations reject and roll back the full import.

### Stats / Diagnostics

- `GET /stats` — Current-project memory statistics. Use `?project=<name>` or `?all_projects=true` to select scope. Store query failures return `500` with a generic JSON error (`{"error":"stats unavailable"}`), not a successful zero-count response. Store-backed project resolution failures return `500` with `{"error":"project resolution failed","code":"project_resolution_failed"}`; invalid, unknown, and ambiguous projects retain their input-error responses.
- `GET /doctor` — Read-only operational diagnostics. Query: `?project=X&check=CHECK_CODE`
  - Returns the same diagnostic report envelope as `engram doctor --json` and MCP `mem_doctor`
  - `project` and `check` are optional; omitted `project` uses current project detection
  - Unknown explicit projects return `404` with `{error, code:"unknown_project", available_projects:[...]}`

### Project Detection / Migration

- `GET /project/current` — Detect the current project. Query: `?cwd=/path/to/repo`
  - Always returns a success envelope with `{project, project_source, project_path, cwd, available_projects}` plus optional `warning`/`error_hint`
  - Ambiguous cwd is a successful discovery response: `project` is empty, `project_source` is `ambiguous`, `available_projects` lists the candidates, and `error_hint` explains why no project was selected.
  - Other current-project-scoped HTTP routes return `404` for an unknown explicit project, `409` with `{error, code:"ambiguous_project", available_projects, project_source, project_path}` for an ambiguous cwd, and `400` for an invalid selector or configuration.
  - For automatic Git detection, Engram creates a private versioned binding in the repository's shared Git metadata. It retains the first normalized remote/root label through remote renames, linked worktrees, and repository moves; the binding is not tracked and clones or forks create their own opaque ID. A corrupt or unwritable binding fails closed: configure `.engram/config.json` with the intended project name rather than relying on a renamed remote. Global local/cloud `project_id` propagation and alias migration remain deferred.
- `POST /projects/rescue-ownership` — Bulk-assign ownership to explicitly selected historical records that carry none. `POST /projects/migrate` is a deprecated compatibility alias routed to the same handler. The JSON body is limited to 8 KiB: `{target_project, confirmed:true, observation_ids?:[], session_ids?:[], prompt_ids?:[]}`.
  - A configured `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN`, matching `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `target_project`, `confirmed:true`, and at least one positive observation/prompt ID or non-blank session ID are required. Missing server token returns `503`; missing or wrong credentials return `401`; malformed or invalid requests return `400`.
  - This route is a convenience, not the only repair. `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> [--session <id>] [--observation <id>] [--prompt <id>]` performs the same operation against the local store and needs no server token, so ownership stays repairable in a zero-config install.
  - `200` returns `{status, complete, blocked, target_project, rescued_observations, rescued_sessions, rescued_prompts, conflicting_records, skipped_records, journaled_local, reconciliation_status}`. Owned records are never reassigned.
  - `status` is `rescued` when `complete` is `true` and everything selected now belongs to `target_project`, or `partially_rescued` when something was left behind. `blocked` then names each item exactly — `{kind, id, reason, owned_by}` with `kind` one of `session`/`observation`/`prompt` and `reason` one of `owned_by_other_project`, `session_owned_by_other_project`, `dependent_record_owned_by_other_project`, `missing` — so a partial outcome is never inferred from counters.
  - The whole plan is resolved before anything is written: which sessions and which records will move is decided first, then applied. An unowned session that already parents a record owned by a different project is therefore left in place rather than moved out from under it, in either direction. A blank project is treated exactly like `NULL` — neither identifies an owner — and no sync mutation is ever journaled for a blank-owned record.
  - `journaled_local` means a canonical pending local mutation exists after the call, whether inserted by the call or already pending. A local journal is not a cloud acknowledgement; autosync reports subsequent reconciliation state.

### Conflict Audit (admin — local runtime only)

These endpoints are served by `engram serve` on the local runtime only. They are not exposed on the cloud runtime. All routes are additive — no existing routes changed.

#### GET /conflicts

List `memory_relations` rows with optional filters.

Query params: `project` (string), `all_projects=true` (explicit global scope), `status` (string — raw `judgment_status`, currently `pending` | `judged` | `orphaned` | `ignored`), `since` (RFC3339), `limit` (int, default 50, max 500 — silently clamped), `offset` (int, default 0).

Response:

```json
{
  "total": 80,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "relations": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "sync_id": "rel-abc123",
      "relation": "conflicts_with",
      "judgment_status": "pending",
      "source_id": "obs-source123",
      "source_title": "Original architecture decision",
      "target_id": "obs-target456",
      "target_title": "Updated architecture decision",
      "created_at": "2026-01-15 12:00:00",
      "updated_at": "2026-01-15 12:30:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### POST /conflicts/judge

Record a verdict on an existing pending relation surfaced by memory conflict detection.

Body:

```json
{
  "judgment_id": "rel-abc123",
  "relation": "related|compatible|scoped|conflicts_with|supersedes|not_conflict",
  "reason": "optional explanation",
  "evidence": "optional JSON or text evidence",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "session_id": "optional-session-id"
}
```

Response:

```json
{ "relation": { "sync_id": "rel-abc123", "judgment_status": "judged" } }
```

Status codes:

- `200` when judged
- `400` for invalid JSON, missing required fields, unknown relation, or invalid relation state

#### POST /conflicts/compare

Persist an agent-supplied semantic verdict for two observation IDs.

Body:

```json
{
  "memory_id_a": 5,
  "memory_id_b": 6,
  "relation": "related|compatible|scoped|conflicts_with|supersedes|not_conflict",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "model": "optional-model-id"
}
```

Response:

```json
{ "sync_id": "rel-abc123" }
```

`not_conflict` persists a judged relation and returns its `sync_id`, preventing future scans from re-evaluating the pair.

Status codes:

- `200` when accepted
- `400` for invalid JSON, missing required fields, invalid relation, invalid confidence, or cross-project pairs
- `404` when either observation ID does not exist

#### GET /conflicts/{relation_id}

Get full detail for one relation row, including source and target observation snippets.

- `200` with full relation + `source_snippet` + `target_snippet`
- `404` with a JSON `error` containing the not-found message when `relation_id` does not exist
- `400` with JSON error body when `relation_id` is not a valid integer

#### GET /conflicts/stats

Aggregate counts for the current project, an explicit project, or every project when `all_projects=true`.

Response:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "by_relation": {
    "conflicts_with": 3,
    "supersedes": 1
  },
  "by_judgment_status": {
    "pending": 3,
    "judged": 1
  },
  "deferred": 4,
  "dead": 1
}
```

#### POST /conflicts/scan

Run conflict candidate scan for a project. Synchronous.

Request body:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "limit": 100,
  "apply": false,
  "max_insert": 100,
  "semantic": false,
  "concurrency": 5,
  "timeout_per_call_seconds": 60,
  "max_semantic": 100
}
```

- `limit` — observations per page (default and maximum 100); rows are ordered by observation ID
- `cursor` — optional `next_cursor` from a completed previous page; omit to start the first page
- `apply: false` (default) — dry-run for the non-semantic lexical scan; reports candidates without inserting pending rows
- `apply: true` — non-semantic lexical scan inserts new pending relation rows up to `max_insert` cap (default 100)
- `semantic: true` — after FTS5 lexical scan, run LLM-judge semantic detection on the candidate pairs returned by `FindCandidates`. It does not discover totally lexically unrelated pairs on its own. Requires `ENGRAM_AGENT_CLI` to be set on the server to `claude` or `opencode`.
- Semantic dry-runs evaluate verdicts without persisting them; `not_conflict` results are reported as skipped. Applied semantic scans persist every valid verdict, including `not_conflict`.
- `concurrency` — worker pool size for parallel LLM calls when `semantic: true` (default 5, range 1–20)
- `timeout_per_call_seconds` — per-LLM-call timeout in seconds when `semantic: true` (default 60, range 1–600)
- `max_semantic` — hard cap on LLM calls per scan (default 100); scan stops collecting new pairs once reached
- Omitted `project` resolves the current project; `all_projects:true` explicitly scans every project
- With `semantic: true`, `concurrency` outside [1, 20] or `timeout_per_call_seconds` outside [1, 600] returns `400`

Response:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "inspected": 100,
  "ranked_queries": 100,
  "candidates_found": 5,
  "next_cursor": 520,
  "already_related": 2,
  "inserted": 0,
  "capped": false,
  "dry_run": true,
  "semantic_judged": 0,
  "semantic_skipped": 0,
  "semantic_errors": 0
}
```

`semantic_judged`, `semantic_skipped`, and `semantic_errors` are always present (zero when `semantic: false`). `next_cursor` is present only after every candidate for the completed page has been handled. Scans never auto-loop through pages.

When any scan cap is reached, including `max_insert` for lexical apply scans or `max_semantic` for semantic scans, no `next_cursor` is returned. Re-run from the same incoming cursor with a higher cap; the response includes this warning:

```json

#### GET /conflicts/deferred

List rows from `sync_apply_deferred`. Query params: `status` (string — `deferred` | `dead` | `applied`), `limit` (int, default 50, max 500), `offset` (int, default 0; accepted for pagination but not echoed in the response envelope).

Response:

### Sync Status (local runtime only)

- `GET /sync/status` — Runtime sync-state status for the local node (`engram serve` only).
- In `engram serve`, sync status is wired to persisted SQLite sync state (project-scoped for detected/current project).
- `?project=<name>` selects one known project; `?all_projects=true` returns HTTP 400 with `code: "unsupported_project_scope"`.
- Response fields when provider is injected:
  - `enabled`
  - `phase`
  - `last_error`
  - `consecutive_failures`
  - `backoff_until`
  - `last_sync_at`
  - `reason_code`
  - `reason_message`
  - `deferred_count` — number of pulled mutations awaiting retry (FK dependency not yet local)
  - `dead_count` — number of pulled mutations that exhausted retries (5 failures) and will not be retried
  - `upgrade` (nested object)
    - `stage`
    - `reason_code`
    - `reason_message`
- `enabled` semantics:
  - `true` when cloud runtime is configured for the resolved + enrolled project, or when meaningful persisted sync state exists for that resolved project while runtime is not configured.
  - `false` when no explicit project scope resolves, cloud runtime is malformed/missing, or enrollment/status checks fail.
- Generic/embedded local server usage may return the fallback `enabled=false` response if no provider is injected.

### Environment Variables

Release update checks are skipped for `version`, `--version`, `-v`, `help`, `--help`, and `-h`. `engram tui` performs its single update check from inside the TUI. Set `ENGRAM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable every update check, including the TUI check.

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR`               | Engram CLI data directory. Empty or whitespace-only values use the platform default; nonblank values are used as provided.                                                                                                                               | `~/.engram`          |
| `ENGRAM_PORT`                   | Override HTTP server port. Use an unsigned decimal value from `1` through `65535`; invalid values fall back to `7437` in `engram serve` and Claude Bash hooks.                                                                                         | `7437`               |
| `ENGRAM_SOCKET`                 | POSIX-only Unix-domain socket path for `engram serve` and Claude Bash hooks. Socket mode listens exclusively on this path; it cannot be combined with an explicit `ENGRAM_PORT` or positional port. The default TCP listener remains unchanged when unset. PowerShell stays TCP-only. Bash hooks warn on stderr if socket transport cannot preserve memory capture. | (unset) |
| `ENGRAM_PROJECT`                | Process-level default project override for `current` project-scoped operations. Precedence: **explicit request project** (`engram save --project`, an MCP tool `project` argument) → **process override** (`engram mcp --project`, then `ENGRAM_PROJECT`) → **cwd detection**. The value must be a project name, not a path. Explicit/process values are checked against known context when an operation must not establish a bucket; documented creation and recovery writes retain that behavior. Deliberately global operations such as `mem_review` list with no project and `mem_search(all_projects=true)` remain global. | cwd-detected project |
| `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN`             | Optional Bearer auth for the local HTTP server. When set, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /observations/{id}`, `DELETE /prompts/{id}`, `GET /export`, and `POST /import` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `POST /projects/rescue-ownership` (and deprecated alias `POST /projects/migrate`) always requires a configured token and matching Bearer credential. Comparison is constant-time. Token is read at request time (no restart needed). Other routes remain open when unset (zero-config default). Ownership repair never depends on this token: `engram projects rescue-ownership` performs the same repair against the local store. | (unset — HTTP rescue route not served; CLI repair still available) |
| `ENGRAM_TIMEZONE`               | Timezone for timestamp display in the TUI and cloud dashboard. Accepts any IANA zone name (e.g. `America/New_York`, `Europe/Berlin`). Falls back to system local time when unset or invalid.                                                               | system local         |
| `ENGRAM_AGENT_CLI`              | LLM runner name used by `engram conflicts scan --semantic` and the HTTP `/conflicts/scan` endpoint. Accepted values: `claude`, `opencode`.                                                                                                                | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`        | Set to `1` to disable GitHub release update checks for every caller, including the TUI. `true`, `yes`, and `on` are also accepted.                                                                                                                       | (unset — eligible commands check for updates) |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC`         | Set to `1` to enable background autosync. Requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER` to also be set.                                                                                                                                         | (unset — disabled)   |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER`           | Cloud server URL used by the autosync manager and `engram sync --cloud`.                                                                                                                                                                                  | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL`           | Postgres DSN for `engram cloud serve`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_HOST`             | Bind host for `engram cloud serve`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `127.0.0.1`          |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_MAX_PUSH_BYTES`   | Max cloud push payload bytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `8388608`            |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`            | Bearer token required in authenticated `engram cloud serve` mode.                                                                                                                                                                                         | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH` | Set to `1` for local insecure cloud serve (no auth). Cannot be combined with `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`.                                                                                                                                                        | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` | Comma-separated project allowlist enforced by `engram cloud serve`. Required in both token-auth and insecure modes. Use `*` to allow all projects (dev/internal deploys) — bypasses per-project name enforcement while still requiring a non-empty project on each request. | (unset) |
| `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`             | Required in authenticated cloud serve mode. Must be explicitly set to a non-default value.                                                                                                                                                                | (unset)              |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN`            | Optional legacy dashboard-admin token in authenticated cloud serve mode. It can access dashboard admin read surfaces, project sync controls, and audit logs, but not managed-user, token, or grant mutations. Ignored/rejected in insecure mode. | (unset) |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER`     | Dedicated secret used to hash managed cloud tokens. Required both to issue tokens via `engram cloud bootstrap admin --issue-token` (and the admin API/dashboard) and to enable managed-token authentication on `engram cloud serve`. Distinct from `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET` on purpose — see [Managed users, tokens, and CLI bootstrap](#managed-users-tokens-and-cli-bootstrap). | (unset)              |

### Conflict Audit CLI (admin)

The `engram conflicts` sub-command provides admin/maintainer access to the conflict layer. It is NOT for end users — end users interact with conflicts via the normal agent conversation flow.

When `--project` is omitted, the cwd-detected project is used.

```
engram conflicts list [--project <name>] [--status <pending|judged|orphaned|ignored>] [--since <RFC3339>] [--limit <N>]
```

List `memory_relations` rows. Output: label-colon aligned columns (`id`, `sync_id`, `relation`, `judgment_status`, `source`, `target`, `created_at`).

```
engram conflicts show <relation_id>
```

Show full detail for one relation: relation_id, sync_id, relation, judgment_status, created_at, updated_at, source_id, source_title, target_id, target_title. Exits non-zero when relation_id does not exist.

```
engram conflicts stats [--project <name>]
```

Print aggregate grouped `judgment_status` counts (`pending` | `judged` | `orphaned` | `ignored`) plus deferred and dead queue sizes. When relation counts exist, also prints `By relation type` counts.

```
engram conflicts scan [--project <name>] [--dry-run] [--apply] [--max-insert <N>]
                      [--since <RFC3339>] [--limit <N>] [--cursor <ID>]
                      [--semantic] [--concurrency <N>] [--timeout-per-call <N>]
                      [--max-semantic <N>] [--yes]
```

Walk observations for the project, run FindCandidates, and report or insert new pending relation rows.

- `--dry-run` (default): for non-semantic lexical scans, reports candidates found with 0 pending rows inserted.
- `--apply`: inserts up to `--max-insert` (default 100) new rows; prints WARNING when cap is reached.
- `--dry-run` and `--apply` are mutually exclusive; combining them in either order exits with an error before opening the store.
- `--since RFC3339`: scan only observations created at or after the timestamp.
- `--limit N`: inspect 1–100 observations per page (default 100), ordered by observation ID.
- `--cursor ID`: resume after a printed `next_cursor`; no automatic follow-up page is run.
- `--semantic`: enable LLM-judge semantic detection on FTS5 candidate pairs returned by `FindCandidates`. It can improve verdict quality for candidates that share lexical terms, but it does not discover totally lexically unrelated pairs on its own. Requires `ENGRAM_AGENT_CLI=claude` or `ENGRAM_AGENT_CLI=opencode`.
- With `--semantic`, `--dry-run` evaluates verdicts without persistence and reports `not_conflict` as skipped. `--apply` persists every valid verdict, including `not_conflict`.
- `--concurrency N`: worker pool size for parallel LLM calls (default 5, max 20).
- `--timeout-per-call N`: per-LLM-call timeout in seconds (default 60).
- `--max-semantic N`: hard cap on LLM calls per scan run (default 100).
- `--yes`: skip the cost-estimate confirmation prompt before LLM calls.

```
engram conflicts deferred [--status <deferred|dead|applied>] [--limit <N>] [--inspect <sync_id>] [--replay]
```

Inspect or replay the `sync_apply_deferred` queue.

- Default: list rows with sync_id, apply_status, retry_count, first_seen_at.
- `--inspect <sync_id>`: print full decoded payload for one row; exits non-zero when not found.
- `--replay`: call `ReplayDeferred()` and print retried/succeeded/failed/dead counts.

### Cloud CLI (opt-in)

- `engram cloud status` — show current cloud config state plus auth/sync readiness without mutating local state. When cloud is configured, also probes the local `engram serve` daemon at `127.0.0.1:7437` (respects `ENGRAM_PORT`) and prints a `Local daemon:` line (`running` / `not running` / `unreachable`) so you can detect a silently dead autosync. The probe currently uses the TCP daemon endpoint, so `ENGRAM_SOCKET` socket-only mode can report the daemon as not running. Exit code is unaffected; the line is informational
- `engram cloud enroll <project>` — enroll one project for cloud replication
- `engram cloud config --server <url>` — persist cloud server URL to `~/.engram/cloud.json`
- `engram cloud serve` — run cloud backend API + dashboard (`/dashboard`) using Postgres config from env
- `engram cloud upgrade doctor --project <project>` — deterministic read-only readiness diagnosis (`ready|blocked`, class/reason)
- `engram cloud upgrade repair --project <project> [--dry-run|--apply]` — deterministic local-safe repair planner/apply (no remote mutation)
- `engram cloud upgrade bootstrap --project <project> [--resume]` — resumable checkpointed enroll/push/verify flow
- `engram cloud upgrade status --project <project>` — show upgrade stage/class/reason
- `engram cloud upgrade rollback --project <project>` — restore pre-upgrade local snapshot before `bootstrap_verified`; blocked afterwards
- `engram cloud repair materialize-mutations --project <project> (--dry-run|--apply)` — explicit server-side Postgres repair that backfills existing `cloud_mutations` into compatible `cloud_chunks` without deleting remote data
- `engram cloud bootstrap admin --username <name> [--email <email>] [--grant-project <project>]... [--issue-token [name]]` — create the first managed admin (see [Managed users, tokens, and CLI bootstrap](#managed-users-tokens-and-cli-bootstrap))
- `engram cloud bootstrap recover-token [--name <name>] [--revoke-existing]` — recover the stranded managed admin token state described below

Cloud enrollment, unenrollment, and explicit cloud sync project inputs decode one
layer of URL path encoding by default (for example, `my%20project` selects
`my project`; `my%2520project` selects `my%20project`). Use `--literal-project`
to skip that decoding when percent sequences are part of the stored name.
Project normalization still applies. Literal plus signs remain plus signs in
both modes; malformed percent escapes are accepted only in literal mode.

```bash
engram cloud enroll --literal-project 'my%20project'
engram cloud status --project 'my%20project'
engram sync --cloud --literal-project --project 'my%20project'
engram sync --cloud --status --literal-project --project 'my%20project'
engram sync --cloud --import --literal-project --project 'my%20project'
engram cloud unenroll 'my%20project' --literal-project
```

`cloud status --project` already accepts literal names and needs no modifier.
For sync, the modifier requires an explicit non-empty `--project` and cloud
mode (`--cloud` or `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SYNC=true`); it cannot be combined with `--all`.
For enroll/unenroll it may appear before or after the single project argument.
Use `--` before positional names beginning with a hyphen (or named `help`),
for example `engram cloud enroll --literal-project -- -project` and
`engram cloud unenroll --literal-project -- -project`. Flags must precede `--`.
For sync, address leading-hyphen names with `--project=-project`, for example
`engram sync --cloud --status --literal-project --project=-project`.
This is input selection only: existing enrollments are not migrated or merged,
and unenrolling a literal name leaves a separately enrolled decoded name intact.
Detection retains percent-encoded project names; no identity migration occurs.
Copy the detected name with `--literal-project` to select that same stored bucket.

`engram sync --cloud --import --project <project>` runs in the foreground and prints plain-text import progress that is safe for non-interactive logs. It emits an initial snapshot, bounded event-count-throttled updates, and a final `100%` / `0 pending` snapshot before the normal import summary. Each snapshot includes local, remote, and pending chunk counts; percentage is based on the pending work captured at import start, so retries do not inflate completion.

Cloud auth token is provided at runtime via `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` (not by a dedicated CLI subcommand).
Cloud server startup fails closed when the token is missing unless `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` is explicitly set for local insecure development.
`ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` cannot be combined with `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
Cloud server always requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` (comma-separated), including insecure mode, so project scope remains server-enforced.
`ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` + `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` are server-side requirements for authenticated mode and must be configured before `engram cloud serve` (or compose startup).
Authenticated mode also requires an explicit non-default `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`; implicit development defaults are rejected.
Dashboard requests support browser login in authenticated mode: use `/dashboard/login` to exchange the bearer token for an HttpOnly dashboard cookie scoped to `/dashboard`. Protected `/dashboard/*` HTML routes require that cookie and do **not** treat raw `Authorization: Bearer ...` headers as an authenticated browser session. Sync API routes (`/sync/pull`, `/sync/pull/{chunkID}`, `/sync/push`, `/sync/mutations/push`, `/sync/mutations/pull`, `/sync/session-authorities`, `/sync/prompt-pair-claims`) remain header-auth only. For cloud authenticated sync and admin requests, the Authorization parser trims outer whitespace and requires exactly two whitespace-delimited fields: a case-insensitive `Bearer` scheme and one credential. Tabs or multiple spaces between fields are accepted; whitespace embedded in the credential and a scheme glued to the credential are rejected. This describes field separation, not an RFC credential-character grammar; it does not describe the local `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN` parser. In insecure mode (`ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` + no `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`), dashboard auth is bypassed and `/dashboard/login` redirects to `/dashboard/`.

`ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` is optional in authenticated mode. Its sessions can access the existing dashboard admin read surfaces, project sync controls, and audit logs, but managed-user, token, and project-grant mutations require a managed admin token.
`ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` is rejected in insecure mode (`ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1`) to avoid an incoherent admin/browser auth path.

Cloud runtime bind host is controlled by `ENGRAM_CLOUD_HOST`:

- default: `127.0.0.1` (local-only, safer default)
- container/compose: set `ENGRAM_CLOUD_HOST=0.0.0.0` so published host ports can reach the cloud server

### Managed users, tokens, and CLI bootstrap

`engram cloud bootstrap admin` creates the first **managed admin** — a principal record stored in the cloud Postgres database (`cloud_principals` / `cloud_human_users`), independent from the legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` / `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` env-token model:

```bash
# Create the first managed admin (safe: refuses to create a duplicate first admin)
engram cloud bootstrap admin --username alice

# Also grant project access and issue a sync token in the same command
engram cloud bootstrap admin --username alice \
  --grant-project my-project \
  --issue-token first-token
```

- `--username` is required; `--email` is optional.
- `--grant-project <project>` may be repeated to grant one or more projects (managed principals are deny-by-default: no grants means no sync access).
- `--issue-token [name]` issues a managed bearer token and prints the **raw token exactly once** in the command output. It is never logged, persisted, or re-printed — store it immediately. Issuing a token requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` to be set to a dedicated secret (distinct from `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`); the command fails clearly, before creating anything, if the pepper is missing.
- Running the command again once a managed admin already exists is rejected (no silent duplicate first-admin creation); the attempt is still recorded as a denied `bootstrap.cli` audit event.
- Every bootstrap attempt (accepted or denied) writes a `bootstrap.cli` audit event to `cloud_auth_audit_log`, with the same non-secret metadata rules (no raw tokens, hashes, or bearer headers) as every other cloud auth audit event.
- Grant/role/duplicate-admin validation reuses the exact same `cloudstore` methods and last-admin guard used by the dashboard's own first-admin bootstrap flow — there is no parallel/looser bootstrap path.

If a historical failed bootstrap left exactly one enabled managed human admin, retained its grants, and created no principal token anywhere in the deployment, run the explicit recovery command:

```bash
engram cloud bootstrap recover-token --name replacement
```

It requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER`, preserves existing grants, and prints the recovered raw token exactly once only after the token and its `bootstrap.cli` recovery audit event commit together. It refuses all other states, including multiple enabled managed human admins or any existing principal token; it does not create users, grants, or partial tokens.

If the bootstrap token was persisted but its one-time output was lost, explicitly opt in to replacement:

```bash
engram cloud bootstrap recover-token --name replacement --revoke-existing
```

This path requires exactly one enabled managed human admin and exactly one active principal token. That token must be unrevoked, never used, and owned by the sole enabled admin; the command atomically revokes it and creates the replacement while preserving grants. Earlier revoked recovery tokens may remain as audit history. If the replacement output is lost again, retry `--revoke-existing` while the current token remains unused; once it has been used, this escape hatch never replaces it. The command refuses used, revoked/inactive, ambiguous, or multiple-active-token states.

**Runtime authentication:** `engram cloud serve` resolves managed tokens first, then falls back to the legacy env-token credentials (`ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` for sync and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` for dashboard access), on every `/sync/*`, `/admin/*`, and dashboard-login request. Authentication does not grant managed-user mutation authority: only a managed-token admin principal may create or enable/disable users, create or revoke tokens, or create or revoke project grants.

- Set `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` to enable managed-token authentication. A token issued by `engram cloud bootstrap admin --issue-token` (or by the dashboard/`/admin/*` token-create routes) then authenticates directly against `/sync/*` and `/admin/*`, and can log into the dashboard as its resolved principal/role.
- If `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` is not set, managed-token authentication is simply disabled: the server still starts normally, and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` / `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` continue to authenticate exactly as before (legacy-only mode).
- Managed principals are deny-by-default for project sync: a managed token only reaches projects explicitly granted via `--grant-project` (or the dashboard/`/admin/*` grant routes). Legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` keeps its existing `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` allowlist behavior, unaffected by managed grants.
- Managed dashboard inventory, details, statistics, browser views, and project sync controls use the principal's grants, not `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS`. Zero grants expose no projects; wildcard access must be explicitly granted. Legacy dashboard credentials remain env-allowlist restricted.
- Explicit `cloud_project_controls` rows register projects, including empty projects shown with zero counts. Existing projects with synced content remain visible for compatibility, subject to the same credential scope. Updating project sync controls refreshes dashboard inventory.
- Disabled managed users, revoked managed tokens, and revoked project grants stop authenticating/authorizing on the very next request — no server restart required.
- No rollback action is required to keep using legacy credentials: legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` continues to use its existing sync allowlist, and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` continues to provide dashboard read access, project sync controls, audit logs, and the first-admin dashboard bootstrap entry point whether or not `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` is configured. The CLI recovery command remains limited to its documented stranded-admin state. Use a managed admin token for managed-user administration.

#### Managed admin API response JSON

These JSON routes require a managed-token admin principal; legacy admins and managed members cannot use them. Successful response shapes are:

| Method | Path | Success JSON |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/admin/users` | Array of users |
| `POST` | `/admin/users` | User object |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/enable` | `{"status":"ok","principal_id":...,"enabled":true}` |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/disable` | `{"status":"ok","principal_id":...,"enabled":false}` |
| `GET` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/tokens` | Array of token metadata; no raw token or token hash |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/tokens` | `{"raw_token":...,"token":...}`; raw token is returned only on creation, alongside token metadata (never the hash) |
| `POST` | `/admin/tokens/{tokenID}/revoke` | `{"status":"ok","token_id":...}` |
| `GET` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/grants` | Array of grants |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/grants` | Grant object |
| `POST` | `/admin/users/{principalID}/grants/{project}/revoke` | `{"status":"ok","principal_id":...,"project":...}` |

User objects contain `principal_id`, `username`, `email`, `display_name`, `role`, `enabled`, and `created_at`; grant objects contain `principal_id`, `project`, `granted_by_principal_id`, and `created_at`. Token metadata contains `id`, `principal_id`, `token_prefix`, `name`, `created_by_principal_id`, and `created_at`, with optional usage/revocation fields. The `POST` payloads are JSON: user creation accepts `username`, `email`, `display_name`, `role`; token creation accepts `name`; token revocation accepts `reason`; grant creation accepts `project`. Enable, disable, and grant revocation use path parameters without a request payload.

Cloud sync is still local-first and explicit:

```bash
# Explicit cloud sync call
engram sync --cloud --project my-project

# Optional env toggle for cloud mode in sync command
ENGRAM_CLOUD_SYNC=1 engram sync --status --project my-project
```

When `engram sync --cloud --project <project>` or autosync hits a known repairable cloud sync/upsert/canonicalization failure, Engram preserves the original error and appends guidance to run:

### Cloud Upgrade Flow

```bash
engram cloud upgrade doctor --project <project>
engram cloud upgrade repair --project <project> --dry-run
engram cloud upgrade repair --project <project> --apply
engram sync --cloud --project <project>
```

Sync/autosync never auto-applies repairs; only the explicit `repair --apply` command mutates local repairable upgrade state.

For pending observation upserts missing only a title, preview with `engram doctor repair --project <project> --check sync_mutation_required_fields --plan`, then use `--apply` instead of `--plan`. Eligible local mutations copy the matching live observation's validated current title verbatim without updating that observation. This repairs the current projection, not historical title truth. The existing blank-local-title path still derives a title from observation content and updates the source. Both paths patch only the queued payload title, preserving sequence and delivery state; neither pushes mutations. Conflicting identity, ownership, or project references are not eligible for current-title copying.

When cloud sync receives `policy_forbidden`, Engram preserves the server's denied project message and advises the server administrator to check `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS`. A managed principal's project grant may also need checking; the client does not expose allowlist contents.

For cloud servers that already accepted mutation pushes before mutation payloads were materialized into chunk history, run the server-side backfill against the Postgres DSN used by `engram cloud serve`:

```bash
ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' engram cloud repair materialize-mutations --project <project> --dry-run
ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' engram cloud repair materialize-mutations --project <project> --apply
```

The backfill is project-scoped, non-destructive, and idempotent: it inserts missing compatible chunks and leaves existing `cloud_mutations` and chunks in place.

`engram cloud serve` also runs this materialization repair automatically for every configured `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` entry at startup. The explicit repair command remains available for operator verification, dry-runs, and re-running a project after an upgrade.

### Local Cloud Bring-Up (Docker + Postgres)

```bash
# 1) SERVER-SIDE startup requirements (configure before startup)
# docker-compose.cloud.yml includes defaults for browser-demo smoke usage:
# ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1
# ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS=smoke-project
docker compose -f docker-compose.cloud.yml up -d

# source-run flow (without compose): set BOTH token + allowlist before startup
# ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL="postgres://engram:engram_dev@127.0.0.1:5433/engram_cloud?sslmode=disable" \
# ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET="replace-with-32+-byte-random-secret" \
# ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN="your-token" \
# ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS="my-project" \
# engram cloud serve

# 2) CLIENT-SIDE CLI setup
# compose runtime flow: published :18080
engram cloud config --server http://127.0.0.1:18080
# compose runtime default is insecure local-dev mode; keep token unset
# client sync preflight only requires the configured cloud server URL; no
# client-side ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH flag is required for compose flow
unset ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN

# 3) Enroll project + run explicit cloud sync
engram cloud enroll smoke-project
engram cloud upgrade doctor --project smoke-project
engram cloud upgrade repair --project smoke-project --dry-run
engram cloud upgrade repair --project smoke-project --apply
engram cloud upgrade bootstrap --project smoke-project --resume
engram cloud upgrade status --project smoke-project
engram sync --cloud --status --project smoke-project

# source-run client endpoint (without compose): default :8080
# engram cloud config --server http://127.0.0.1:8080

# cloud mode enforces a single explicit project scope
# engram sync --cloud --all  # blocked by design
```

Deterministic reason codes shared across store/CLI/server:

- `blocked_unenrolled`
- `auth_required`
- `cloud_config_error`
- `policy_forbidden` — check the server-side `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` policy for the denied project; a managed principal's project grant may also need checking. The client does not expose allowlist contents.
- `paused`
- `transport_failed`

### Cloud Status Visibility Matrix

Cloud failure visibility must stay deterministic across supported surfaces:

| Scenario                                                                                               | Expected deterministic reason        | Surfaces                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Unconfigured cloud sync preflight (missing server URL)                                                 | `cloud_config_error`                 | CLI stderr                  |
| Cloud runtime not configured in status provider (takes precedence even if project scope is unresolved) | `cloud_not_configured`               | `/sync/status`              |
| `/sync/status` project cannot be resolved (no query/default project) while cloud runtime is configured | `project_required`                   | `/sync/status`              |
| Unenrolled project cloud sync                                                                          | `blocked_unenrolled`                 | CLI stderr + `/sync/status` |
| Runtime auth/policy failure from remote API                                                            | `auth_required` / `policy_forbidden` | CLI stderr + `/sync/status` |
| Explicit paused state                                                                                  | `paused`                             | `/sync/status`              |
| Remote/network failure                                                                                 | `transport_failed`                   | CLI stderr + `/sync/status` |

`engram sync --cloud --status --project <name>` is read-only: it does **not** mutate `/sync/status` lifecycle fields.

Machine-actionable validation/policy failures from cloud sync routes include:

- `error_class` (`repairable` | `blocked` | `policy` | `invalid_request`)
- `error_code` (stable deterministic code)
- `error` (human-readable message)

This envelope is used consistently by `/sync/push` validation/control failures and by `/sync/pull` / `/sync/pull/{chunkID}` project-required or policy failures. `/sync/mutations/push` uses the envelope for empty batches, empty projects, project policy failures, and pause-control failures; relation-payload validation currently returns `error`, `reason_code`, and `invalid` instead. `/sync/mutations/pull` success responses include the project envelope, but internal listing errors currently use plain `http.Error`.

## MCP Project Resolution

Engram resolves the project at MCP tool call time. The default source is the **server process working directory** (cwd), not MCP startup state, but some write tools have stronger context: `mem_session_start(directory=...)` resolves from the provided directory, and `mem_save` may use a validated explicit `project` or an existing `session_id` project before falling back to cwd detection. The explicit field is treated as a **validated selection**, not a free-form creation hint. This eliminates project drift caused by agents supplying different names for the same repo.

### Detection algorithm

| Case | Condition                                                                                 | Source            | Project                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | nearest `.engram/config.json` exists within the enclosing git root, or at cwd outside git | `config`          | `project_name` from config         |
| 2    | cwd is inside a git repo that currently has an `origin` remote                              | `git_remote`      | if the binding is absent, initialize it from the remote repo name; otherwise reuse the stored binding label |
| 3    | cwd is inside a git repo that currently has no `origin` remote                               | `git_root`        | if the binding is absent, initialize it from the git-root basename; otherwise reuse the stored binding label |
| 4    | cwd has exactly one git-repo child                                                        | `git_child`       | child's canonical name: its config first, then existing Git binding or origin remote, then repository-root basename (warning included) |
| 5    | cwd has multiple git-repo children                                                        | `ambiguous` error | — write tools fail fast            |
| 6    | no git repo near cwd                                                                      | `dir_basename`    | basename of cwd                    |

A promoted child's project name and path match detection from inside that child; its source remains `git_child` with an advisory warning. Invalid child config or Git binding fails closed instead of promoting a directory basename. An explicit config at the parent takes precedence over child scanning. Historical memories are not migrated by detection.

Child scan constraints: depth=1, max 20 entries, 200ms timeout, skips hidden dirs and noise dirs (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `target`, `dist`, `build`, `.idea`, `.vscode`).

The Git binding is private to each clone and shared by that clone's linked worktrees. Independent clones and forks establish fresh opaque bindings. Cross-clone identity sharing and alias propagation are not currently supported.

### Initialize an explicit project identity

Use `engram init [project_name] [--force]` to write `.engram/config.json` in the current directory. When `project_name` is omitted, Engram uses the current directory basename. `--force` replaces an existing config; without it, init stops and tells you that the config already exists.

This is the explicit resolution path for a non-Git aggregator workspace that contains multiple child repositories. Run `engram init aggregator-name` at the aggregator root so its config resolves the workspace identity before child-repository scanning reports ambiguity.

### Response envelope

Most successful MCP tool responses use this envelope:

```json
{
  "project": "engram",
  "project_source": "git_remote",
  "project_path": "/home/user/engram",
  "result": "...(tool output)..."
}
```

Error responses include `available_projects` when the error is `ambiguous_project` or `unknown_project`.

When a Git repository binding cannot be read or created, MCP returns `repository_binding_unavailable` with guidance to configure the repository's `.engram/config.json` with the intended canonical project. This is not an ambiguity and does not include ambiguity recovery tokens.

Exceptions:

- `mem_current_project` returns detection fields directly (`project`, `project_source`, `project_path`, `cwd`, `available_projects`, optional `warning` / `error_hint`) and does not wrap them in `result`.
- `mem_doctor` returns the same JSON report shape as `engram doctor --json`; it uses read-project resolution before running diagnostics but does not wrap the report in the common MCP envelope.

### Write tools (explicit/session/cwd project resolution)

`mem_session_start` resolves from its explicit `directory` argument when supplied; otherwise it auto-detects from cwd. `mem_session_end` and `mem_capture_passive` auto-detect project from cwd; any `project` argument the LLM sends to them is ignored. `mem_session_summary` supports explicit project override (`project`, `project_choice_reason`, `recovery_token`) matching `mem_save`'s project resolution.

`mem_update` requires `id` and caller-supplied `expected_project`. Native MCP also checks ownership against the known current/process project; the assertion does not bypass those checks, malformed/unknown process overrides, or ambiguous-project recovery protections. It no longer falls back to the stored owner for writes when cwd is ambiguous. `mem_get_observation` retains its read-only stored-owner fallback.

`mem_save` resolves writes by precedence: validated explicit `project`, project already associated with `session_id`, repo/cwd detection (nearest `.engram/config.json` within the enclosing git root, git remote/root/child), then directory-basename fallback.

Guardrails:

- Invalid explicit `project` names fail loudly instead of silently falling back.
- Valid-looking explicit `project` names are accepted only when backed by known context: an existing local project in the store, a matching existing session project, the nearest resolvable `.engram/config.json`, or exact ambiguous-project recovery after the user selected one available project.
- An unbacked explicit `project` fails loudly and does not create a new bucket.
- An unknown non-empty `session_id` normally fails with `unknown_session`. Only genuine cwd ambiguity offers a short-lived MCP-local `recovery_token` bound to that session ID, canonical context, and exact unique candidate paths. After explicit user selection, `mem_save`, `mem_save_prompt`, or `mem_session_summary` may register that ID as project-owned before writing, using `project`, `project_choice_reason=user_selected_after_ambiguous_project`, and the token. A bare explicit project cannot register an unknown session, even when the project already exists. Recovery never resumes an ended session or changes an unrelated owner.
- If both explicit `project` and `session_id` are supplied, they must resolve to the same normalized project or `mem_save` fails with a structured error and does not write.
- An explicit `session_id` is authoritative. When a write omits it, Engram uses the current process directory only to narrow active non-manual runtime sessions for the resolved project. A valid, unexpired local lease takes precedence over legacy unleased rows in the same directory; every live leased owner remains a candidate, so multiple live leases fail closed. Expired, malformed, and nonblank invalid leases are excluded. Only when a directory has no live lease do unleased rows use the legacy seven-day effective-activity fallback (latest observation, then `started_at`). This precedence is applied independently for every requested directory. Engram attaches to a session only when exactly one candidate remains, uses the project manual-save session when none remain, and fails closed when multiple candidates remain rather than selecting by recency. Selection is read-only and never changes `ended_at`. Directory is not session identity; callers with concurrent sessions must supply `session_id`, end other active matching sessions, or save independently with `engram save "TITLE" "CONTENT" --project PROJECT --type TYPE --topic TOPIC_KEY`. The CLI fallback writes to an independent project manual-save session and does not bind it to the current MCP session. Claude Code currently may require ending other active matching sessions because its MCP transport does not expose runtime identity to each tool call.
- `project_choice_reason=user_selected_after_ambiguous_project` is only honored when cwd resolution is actually ambiguous. On a non-ambiguous cwd, stale recovery flags do not override explicit-project precedence or session mismatch validation.
- If ambiguous-project recovery is active, `project` must exactly match one of the previously returned `available_projects`; invented or normalized guesses are rejected. Tokens expire after five minutes and are valid only in the issuing MCP process. Same-choice retries are allowed; changed-choice, wrong-session, changed-context/candidate, and duplicate case-normalized candidate-path requests fail closed. Tokens are recovery capabilities, not OpenCode authentication.
- Exact ambiguous-project choices can still fail with `project_name_collision` when multiple available names collapse to the same stored project bucket after normalization. Rename or disambiguate the colliding projects before retrying.
- Ordinary explicit `mem_save(project=...)` calls can also fail with `project_name_collision` when the raw explicit name collapses into an existing config-backed, session-backed, or store-backed project bucket, such as `foo--bar` colliding with `foo-bar`.

For monorepos, detection now honors the **nearest** `.engram/config.json` at or below the enclosing git root. That lets `repo/backend/.engram/config.json` and `repo/frontend/.engram/config.json` behave as independent projects without letting `~/.engram/config.json` leak into nested workspaces.

`mem_save_prompt` keeps the older cwd/default behavior by default and only uses `project` for the narrow ambiguous-project recovery override: after a previous `ambiguous_project` error, the agent may retry with `project=<one of available_projects>` and `project_choice_reason=user_selected_after_ambiguous_project`, with the returned `recovery_token`. A supplied session normally remains authoritative; the same narrow token-validated unknown-session bootstrap applies.

### Read tools (optional project override)

`mem_search`, `mem_context`, `mem_timeline`, `mem_stats`, `mem_doctor`, and `mem_get_observation` accept an optional `project` argument validated against known projects. Unknown explicit project names return a structured error with `available_projects`. When `project` is omitted, the process override takes precedence over cwd detection. For `mem_get_observation`, the resolved project selects response-envelope context only; retrieval remains ID-based and does not filter by observation ownership.

### Admin tools

`mem_delete` requires `id` and caller-supplied `expected_project`; optional `hard_delete=true` permanently deletes the observation. The owner assertion is not a project-resolution override.

`mem_merge_projects` requires `from` (comma-separated, explicitly named source project names) and `to` (canonical target project name). Case/trim variants and matching `-`/`_` separator variants (for example, `foo-bar` to `foo_bar`) are allowed; unrelated names and missing sources are rejected. It does not accept or auto-detect `project`.

### mem_current_project

Use `mem_current_project` as the first call in a session to inspect the detection result:

```json
{
  "project": "engram",
  "project_source": "git_remote",
  "project_path": "/home/user/engram",
  "cwd": "/home/user/engram",
  "available_projects": [],
  "warning": ""
}
```

Returns success even when cwd is ambiguous — empty `project` + non-empty `available_projects` signals the agent to navigate to a specific repo before writing.

### mem_search

Search persistent memory across all sessions. Supports FTS5 full-text search with type/project/scope/limit filters.

Set `all_projects: true` to search across every project instead of the resolved one. This bypasses project detection entirely and ignores the `project` argument, so an agent can recall a decision logged elsewhere without knowing the project key. The response envelope reports `project_source: "all_projects"` and an empty `project` to reflect the cross-project scope.

Scope values accepted by the `scope` parameter: `project` (default), `personal`, `global`. When `scope: personal` is passed without an explicit `project` override, the project filter is cleared and personal observations are searched across all projects (cross-project personal scope).

Each structured search result includes lifecycle metadata: `state` (`active` or `needs_review`) and, when set, `review_after`. Text output also appends `state: needs_review` for stale observations.

When an observation has judged relations in `memory_relations`, the result entry includes annotation lines immediately after the title/content block:

```
supersedes: #<id> (<title>)       — this memory supersedes another
superseded_by: #<id> (<title>)    — another memory supersedes this one
conflicts: #<id> (<title>)        — judged conflict with another memory
conflict: contested by #<id> (pending)  — pending (not yet judged)
```

Multiple annotation lines appear when multiple relations apply — one per related observation. Titles are retrieved via JOIN (no N+1 queries). When the related observation has been deleted, `(deleted)` replaces the title. Agent parsers should match by prefix — these prefixes are stable across versions (REQ-012).

Pending relations (from `mem_save` conflict surfacing, before `mem_judge` is called) produce the `conflict: contested by #<id> (pending)` form. Judged relations produce the enriched form with title.

### mem_save

Save structured observations. The tool description teaches agents the format:

- **title**: Short, searchable (e.g. "JWT auth middleware")
- **type**: `decision` | `architecture` | `bugfix` | `pattern` | `config` | `discovery` | `learning`
- **scope**: `project` (default) | `personal` | `global` — see [Team Usage](docs/TEAM-USAGE.md) for conventions and sync caveats
- **topic_key**: optional canonical topic id (e.g. `architecture/auth-model`) used to upsert evolving memories
- **capture_prompt**: optional boolean, default `true`; when current prompt context is available in the same MCP process for the same project/session, Engram best-effort records it alongside the observation. If that process-local context is unavailable or prompt capture fails, `mem_save` still succeeds. Automated artifact saves should pass `false`.
- **content**: Structured with `**What**`, `**Why**`, `**Where**`, `**Learned**`; required unless the legacy `observation` alias is provided
- **observation**: backward-compatible alias for `content` for older/raw MCP clients; prefer `content` for new integrations

Exact duplicate saves are deduplicated in a rolling time window using a normalized content hash + project + scope + type + title.
When `topic_key` is provided, `mem_save` upserts the latest observation in the same `project + scope + topic_key`, incrementing `revision_count` and attributing it to the latest writer session.
Save responses include lifecycle metadata for the saved observation: computed `state` (`active` or `needs_review`) and `review_after` when the observation type has a review cycle. Content is redacted before the configured storage limit is applied; that limit and truncation metadata (`original_bytes`, `limit_bytes`) are UTF-8 bytes. MCP save/update responses include `truncated`, and warn when truncation occurs.

### mem_update

Update an observation by ID, with mandatory `expected_project` supplied by the caller (for example, `{ "id": 42, "expected_project": "engram", "title": "Corrected" }`). Public schema supports partial updates for `title`, `content`, `find`, `replace`, `type`, `scope`, and `topic_key`. `find` and `replace` are paired literal, case-sensitive global replacement inputs and cannot be combined with `content`; empty finds and replacements with no effective normalized change preserve content.

This intentionally breaks mutation clients that omit the owner assertion. Native MCP and the in-repository Pi adapter require it; an external gentle-engram relay must be adapted separately and is not fixed by this repository change. Never read the target observation to manufacture a missing expectation. CLI/internal maintenance store APIs retain their unguarded entry points.

### mem_review

Review observation lifecycle state. Available in the `agent` profile (`engram mcp --tools=agent`).

Actions:

- `action: "list"` — returns observations whose `review_after` has passed. Optional parameters: `project` and `limit` (default 10).
- `action: "mark_reviewed"` — requires `observation_id`; resets that observation's local review cycle using its type decay policy. The legacy `id` alias is accepted for compatibility.

`mark_reviewed` is local-only for now: `review_after` is intentionally not part of sync payloads in this phase, so resetting the review cycle does not enqueue a sync mutation or propagate to other machines.

### mem_pin

Pin a local observation so it appears before recent observations in memory context. Pinned state is **local to this device and is not synced**. Available in the `agent` profile (`engram mcp --tools=agent`).

Parameters:

- **id** (required): int — observation ID to pin

Returns `{ "result": "Memory #N pinned", "id": N, "sync_id": ..., "pinned": true }`. Idempotent: pinning an already-pinned observation succeeds without change. Errors: missing/zero `id` ("id is required"), or a store failure ("Failed to update pin state: ...").

### mem_unpin

Unpin a local observation so it only appears in normal recency order in memory context. Pinned state is **local to this device and is not synced**. Available in the `agent` profile (`engram mcp --tools=agent`).

Parameters:

- **id** (required): int — observation ID to unpin

Returns `{ "result": "Memory #N unpinned", "id": N, "sync_id": ..., "pinned": false }`. Idempotent: unpinning an already-unpinned observation succeeds without change. Errors: missing/zero `id` ("id is required"), or a store failure ("Failed to update pin state: ...").

### mem_suggest_topic_key

Suggest a stable `topic_key` from `type + title` (or content fallback). Uses family heuristics like `architecture/*`, `bug/*`, `decision/*`, etc. Use before `mem_save` when you want evolving topics to upsert into a single observation.

### mem_delete

Delete an observation by ID with mandatory caller-supplied `expected_project`, for example `{ "id": 42, "expected_project": "engram", "hard_delete": true }`. Uses soft-delete by default (`deleted_at`); optional hard-delete for permanent removal. Both modes reject invalid or mismatched assertions before changing data.

### mem_save_prompt

Save user prompts — records what the user asked so future sessions have context about user goals. It applies the same post-redaction byte limit and truncation metadata as `mem_save`; `mem_save_prompt` warns when it truncates.
When called in the same MCP process, this also feeds process-local current prompt context used by later `mem_save` calls with `capture_prompt=true`. The same MCP process lifecycle must receive the prompt context before the later save; prompt capture is best-effort and `mem_save` still succeeds when no context is available.

### mem_context

Get recent memory context from previous sessions — shows sessions, prompts, and observations, with optional scope filtering for observations.

When `project` is omitted, context is scoped to the resolved current project (process override before cwd detection). This is not an all-project query. `scope: personal` without an explicit project retains its cross-project personal-memory behavior.

Scope values accepted by the `scope` parameter: `project` (default), `personal`, `global`. When `scope: personal` is passed without an explicit `project` override, the project filter is cleared and personal observations are returned across all projects (cross-project personal scope).

MCP `mem_context` uses a 16 KiB default budget for the complete tool result and caps `max_bytes` at 64 KiB. `max_bytes` must be a positive integral number; absent, mistyped, non-positive, `NaN`, and fractional values fall back to the 16 KiB default. It includes at most 20 pinned observations by default. When the complete result exceeds its budget, truncation is UTF-8-safe and appends a visible `[truncated]` marker when the marker fits. `compact=true` removes inline content previews from pinned and recent-observation bullets, retaining their type and title. These MCP rules are distinct from the HTTP `GET /context` behavior documented above.

### mem_stats

Show memory system statistics — sessions, observations, prompts, projects.

### mem_timeline

Progressive disclosure: after searching, drill into chronological context around a specific observation. Shows N observations before and after within the same session.
The optional project filter is enforced: an observation owned by another project is not returned.

### mem_get_observation

Get full untruncated content of a specific observation by ID. The optional `project` argument is validated against known projects and selects the project context in the response envelope; it does not filter the ID-based lookup by observation ownership. When omitted, the tool uses the process project override or cwd detection.

Parameters:

- **id** (required): int — observation ID to retrieve
- **project** (optional): string — explicit project context; unknown names return a structured error with `available_projects`

### mem_session_summary

Save comprehensive end-of-session summary:

```
## Goal
## Instructions
## Discoveries
## Accomplished
## Next Steps
## Relevant Files
```

### mem_session_start

Register the start of a new coding session.

If the supplied session ID has already ended, the request is rejected with the structured error code `session_already_ended`, which includes that session ID. Choose a new session ID to continue; ended sessions cannot be reopened. New session IDs and IDs for active sessions remain accepted.

### mem_session_end

Mark a session as completed with optional summary.

### mem_capture_passive

Extract structured learnings from text output. Looks for `## Key Learnings:` sections and saves each numbered/bulleted item as a separate observation. Duplicates are automatically skipped.

### mem_merge_projects

**Admin tool.** Merge explicitly named case/trim or corresponding `-`/`_` separator variants into a canonical name. Requires `from` as a comma-separated list of source project names and `to` as the target canonical name. For example, `foo-bar` may merge into `foo_bar`, but unrelated names are rejected. Sources must exist; the CLI retains its stricter rules. Observations, sessions, prompts, pending sync identity, and enrollment migrate together. A no-op reports that no records moved.

### mem_current_project

Detect the current project from the working directory. Returns `project`, `project_source`, `project_path`, `cwd`, `available_projects`, and `warning`. Never returns an error — even on ambiguous cwd it returns success with an empty `project` and non-empty `available_projects`. Recommended as the first call when starting a session.

### mem_list_projects

List every project known to Engram with per-project `observation_count`, `session_count`, `prompt_count`, and known `directories`, ordered by observation count descending — the same view as `engram projects list`. Returns `{ "projects": [...], "count": N }`.

Included in the `agent` profile; `engram mcp` registers all tools by default, so `--tools=agent` is not required to use it.

Result semantics:

- **Empty store** — successful response with `{ "projects": [], "count": 0 }`. Discovery never fails just because nothing is stored yet.
- **Store-query failure** — returns a tool error (`List projects failed: ...`) instead of a success envelope, so the agent knows discovery failed rather than trusting an empty answer.

Use it for cross-project discovery when the working directory matches no known project, then scope `mem_search`/`mem_context` to the chosen project.

### mem_doctor

Run read-only operational diagnostics. Returns the same JSON report shape as `engram doctor --json`, with optional `project` and `check` filters. The optional `project` override is validated with read-project resolution before diagnostics run.

### mem_judge

Record a verdict on a pending memory conflict. When `mem_save` returns `candidates[]` and `judgment_required: true`, the agent inspects the candidates and calls `mem_judge` to mark the relation between the saved memory and a candidate.

Parameters:

- **judgment_id** (required): the `judgment_id` returned by `mem_save`
- **relation** (required): `related` | `compatible` | `scoped` | `conflicts_with` | `supersedes` | `not_conflict`
- **reason** (optional): short text explaining the verdict
- **evidence** (optional): free-form text or JSON the agent can use to justify the call (e.g., quoted excerpts from both memories)
- **confidence** (optional, default 1.0): 0.0–1.0; if the value is below 0.7 the agent SHOULD ask the user before calling

Re-judging an existing relation overwrites it (deliberate revision). Two agents judging the same pair persist as separate rows — Phase 1 surfaces both; cross-actor reconciliation is Phase 2.

Search results subsequently expose annotation lines like `supersedes: #<id> (<title>)`, `superseded_by: #<id> (<title>)`, and `conflicts: #<id> (<title>)` so the recalling agent sees relevant verdicts at-a-glance. For enrolled projects with autosync enabled, judgments propagate to other machines via the cloud mutation pipeline — the annotation appears in `mem_search` results on any machine that has pulled the relevant mutations.

### mem_compare

Records a verdict on a semantic comparison between two memories. The agent reads both memories, judges the relationship using its LLM reasoning, and calls `mem_compare` to persist the verdict. Unlike `mem_judge` (which resolves a pre-existing `pending` candidate surfaced by `mem_save`), `mem_compare` creates a new relation row directly — useful for proactive semantic analysis that goes beyond FTS5 lexical matching.

Available in the `agent` profile (`engram mcp --tools=agent`).

Parameters:

- **memory_id_a** (required): int — observation ID of the first memory
- **memory_id_b** (required): int — observation ID of the second memory
- **relation** (required): string — one of `conflicts_with` | `supersedes` | `scoped` | `related` | `compatible` | `not_conflict`
- **confidence** (required): float 0.0..1.0
- **reasoning** (required): string — explanation of the verdict (max 200 chars)
- **model** (optional): string — model name for provenance (e.g. `"claude-haiku-4-5"`)

Behavior:

- Persists a relation row via `JudgeBySemantic` with system provenance (`marked_by_kind="system"`, `marked_by_actor="engram"`)
- Idempotent: the same `(source_id, target_id)` pair updates the existing row rather than inserting a duplicate
- `not_conflict` verdicts persist as judged relations, suppressing future candidate scans without appearing in conflict-facing lists or statistics
- Cross-project relations are rejected with an error

## Memory Protocol

The Memory Protocol teaches agents **when** and **how** to use Engram's MCP tools. Without it, the agent has the tools but no behavioral guidance. Add this to your agent's prompt file (see [Agent Setup](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md) for per-agent locations).

### WHEN TO SAVE (mandatory)

Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY after any of these:

- Bug fix completed
- Architecture or design decision made
- Non-obvious discovery about the codebase
- Configuration change or environment setup
- Pattern established (naming, structure, convention)
- User preference or constraint learned

Format for `mem_save`:

- **title**: Verb + what — short, searchable (e.g. "Fixed N+1 query in UserList", "Chose Zustand over Redux")
- **type**: `bugfix` | `decision` | `architecture` | `discovery` | `pattern` | `config` | `preference`
- **scope**: `project` (default) | `personal` | `global`
- **topic_key** (optional, recommended for evolving decisions): stable key like `architecture/auth-model`
- **content**:

  ```
  **What**: One sentence — what was done
  **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
  **Where**: Files or paths affected
  **Learned**: Gotchas, edge cases, things that surprised you (omit if none)
  ```

### Topic update rules (mandatory)

- Different topics must not overwrite each other (e.g. architecture vs bugfix)
- Reuse the same `topic_key` to update an evolving topic instead of creating new observations
- If unsure about the key, call `mem_suggest_topic_key` first and then reuse it
- Use `mem_update` when you have an exact observation ID to correct

### DELIVERY GUARANTEE

Memory operations are internal bookkeeping, never the user-facing answer. Complete required memory work before composing the completed-task reply; send the complete answer as the final message of the turn with no later tool calls. If memory work fails or needs follow-up, still send the answer.

### WHEN TO SEARCH MEMORY

When the user asks to recall something — any variation of "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", "recordar", "acordate", or references to past work:

1. First call `mem_context` — checks recent session history (fast, cheap)
2. If not found, call `mem_search` with relevant keywords (FTS5 full-text search)
3. If you find a match, use `mem_get_observation` for full untruncated content

Also search memory PROACTIVELY when:

- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- The user mentions a topic you have no context on — check if past sessions covered it

### SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (mandatory)

Before ending a session or saying "done" / "listo" / "that's it", you MUST call `mem_session_summary` with this structure:

```
## Goal
[What we were working on this session]

## Instructions
[User preferences or constraints discovered — skip if none]

## Discoveries
- [Technical findings, gotchas, non-obvious learnings]

## Accomplished
- [Completed items with key details]

## Next Steps
- [What remains to be done — for the next session]

## Relevant Files
- path/to/file — [what it does or what changed]
```

This is NOT optional. If you skip this, the next session starts blind.

### PASSIVE CAPTURE

When completing a task, include a `## Key Learnings:` section at the end of your response with numbered items. Engram will automatically extract and save these as observations.

Example:

```
## Key Learnings:

1. bcrypt cost=12 is the right balance for our server performance
2. JWT refresh tokens need atomic rotation to prevent race conditions
```

You can also call `mem_capture_passive(content)` directly with any text that contains a learning section.

### AFTER COMPACTION

If you see a message about compaction or context reset:

1. IMMEDIATELY call `mem_session_summary` with the compacted summary content
2. Then call `mem_context` to recover additional context from previous sessions
3. Only THEN continue working

Do not skip step 1. Without it, everything done before compaction is lost from memory.

---

## Project Name Normalization

Engram automatically prevents project name drift — the same project saved under different names (`"engram"` vs `"Engram"` vs `"  ENGRAM  "`) by different clients or users.

### Automatic normalization

All project names are normalized on write and read: **lowercase**, **trimmed**, **collapsed hyphens/underscores**. Hyphens and underscores are not interchangeable, so `"engram-memory"` and `"engram_memory"` are not equivalent. If a name is changed during normalization, a warning is included in the response.

### Auto-detection

MCP tools resolve project names at call time using the shared detection chain:

1. Nearest `.engram/config.json` `project_name` within the enclosing git root, or at cwd outside git
2. Git repository with an `origin` remote: initialize an absent private binding from the normalized repo name, otherwise reuse the stored binding label
3. Git repository without an `origin` remote: initialize an absent private binding from the normalized root directory name, otherwise reuse the stored binding label
4. Single git-repo child of cwd
5. Multiple git-repo children of cwd returns `ambiguous_project` with `available_projects`
6. Current working directory basename

`engram mcp` accepts a process-level default project via `--project <name>` / `--project=<name>` or `ENGRAM_PROJECT=<name>`. For current-project tools, this override takes precedence over cwd detection throughout the MCP process. It must be a project name, not a path; operations that cannot establish project context reject unknown overrides. Deliberately global tools retain their own omission contract, including `mem_review` list without a project filter.

The same precedence rule is applied by every entry point, so identity never depends on which binary wrote the record: an **explicit request project** (`engram save --project`, an MCP tool `project` argument) wins first, then the **process override** (`engram mcp --project`, then `ENGRAM_PROJECT`), then **cwd detection**.

### Ownership on legacy sessions

A database upgraded from the schema where `sessions.project` was nullable still holds sessions that identify no project. Those sessions keep accepting writes: ownership is established forward rather than demanded retroactively.

- When the write resolves a project through the chain above, its unowned parent session **adopts** that project in the same transaction, and the move is journaled like any other ownership change. The record and its session end up in agreement, so no record is left split from its parent.
- Adoption is refused in one case: an unowned session that already parents a record owned by a *different* project. Claiming it there would split that record from its session, so the write fails with `project_ownership_ambiguous` (HTTP `409`) and the operator resolves it explicitly.
- A write that resolves no project at all against an unowned session fails with `project_ownership_required` (HTTP `409`).

Both errors carry a `remedy` field naming the exact command to run: `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> --session <id>`. That command reaches the local store directly and needs no server token, so recovery stays available in a zero-config install. Bulk repair remains available over HTTP through `POST /projects/rescue-ownership` when `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN` is configured.

### Similar-project warnings

When saving to a project that doesn't exist yet, Engram checks for similar existing project names (Levenshtein distance, substring, case-insensitive matching) and warns the agent if a likely variant already exists.

### Retroactive cleanup

Use `engram projects merge --from acmeapi --to acme-api --dry-run` to preview one explicitly named separator variant without mutation, then `--apply` to merge it. Exactly one mode and both names are required; unrelated or normalized-identical names are rejected. Preview reports observation, session, and prompt counts plus sync identity changes, even with zero rows. It is point-in-time: apply revalidates and reports actual moved row counts, which may differ. Apply's sync identity message is qualitative, not an actual-change count or a claim that the preview's sync state still holds. Sync-only merges can succeed with zero record moves. The reserved `inbox` project cannot be a merge destination, including for an explicitly named separator variant such as `in-box`; preview and apply both reject it.

Use `engram projects consolidate` to interactively merge legacy project names that are equivalent after normalization, or `mem_merge_projects` for agent-driven consolidation.

Use `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> [--session <id>] [--observation <id>] [--prompt <id>]` to assign ownership to legacy rows that carry none. It prints how many sessions, observations, and prompts moved, and — when anything was left behind — exactly which items and why. It works against the local store, so it needs no running server and no `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN`.

## Features

### Full-Text Search (FTS5)

- Searches across title, content, tool_name, type, and project
- Query sanitization: wraps each word in quotes to avoid FTS5 syntax errors
- Supports type and project filters

### Timeline (Progressive Disclosure)

Three-layer pattern for token-efficient memory retrieval:

1. `mem_search` — Find relevant observations
2. `mem_timeline` — Drill into chronological neighborhood of a result
3. `mem_get_observation` — Get full untruncated content

### Privacy Tags

`<private>...</private>` content is stripped at TWO levels:

1. **Plugin layer** (TypeScript) — Strips before data leaves the process
2. **Store layer** (Go) — `stripPrivateTags()` runs inside `AddObservation()` and `AddPrompt()`

Example: `Set up API with <private>sk-abc123</private>` becomes `Set up API with [REDACTED]`

### User Prompt Storage

Separate table captures what the USER asked (not just tool calls). Gives future sessions the "why" behind the "what". Full FTS5 search support.

### Export / Import

Share memories across machines, backup, or migrate:

- `engram export` — Versioned JSON backup of sessions, observations, prompts, local pin state, and memory-relation metadata
- `engram import <file>` — Load an atomic backup transaction. Version `0.2.0` preserves pins and relations; legacy `0.1.0` backups without those fields remain compatible, while unsupported versions fail before mutation. Orphaned relation audit rows may retain missing endpoint observations; other dangling relations or missing superseding relations fail the complete transaction.
- `engram export --help` and `engram import --help` — Show command-specific usage and options without an update check, configuration lookup, database migration, or store access. Export accepts an optional output filename and `--project NAME` or `--all`; import requires a backup filename for normal operation.

### Git Sync (Chunked)

Share memories through git repositories using compressed chunks with a manifest index.

- `engram sync` — Exports new memories as a gzipped JSONL chunk to `.engram/chunks/`
- `engram sync --all` — Exports ALL memories from every project
- `engram sync --import` — Imports chunks listed in the manifest that haven't been imported yet
- `engram sync --status` — Shows how many chunks exist locally vs remotely (filesystem mode)
- `engram sync --cloud --status --project <name>` — Shows local, remote, and pending chunk counts for the specified cloud project
- `engram sync --project NAME` — Filters export to a specific project
- Local sync projects hard deletes as canonical observation, prompt, and session delete mutations; child deletes precede their session and remain replay-safe through manifest history.

```
.engram/
├── manifest.json          <- index of all chunks (small, git-mergeable)
├── chunks/
│   ├── a3f8c1d2.jsonl.gz <- chunk 1 (gzipped JSONL)
│   ├── b7d2e4f1.jsonl.gz <- chunk 2
│   └── ...
└── engram.db              <- local working DB (gitignored)
```

**Why chunks?**

- Each `engram sync` creates a NEW chunk — old chunks are never modified
- No merge conflicts: each dev creates independent chunks, git just adds files
- Chunks are content-hashed (SHA-256 prefix) — each chunk is imported only once
- The manifest is the only file git diffs — it's small and append-only
- Compressed: a chunk with 8 sessions + 10 observations = ~2KB

### Agent-Driven Compression

Instead of a separate LLM service, the agent itself compresses observations. The agent already has the model, context, and API key.

**Two levels:**

- **Per-action** (`mem_save`): Structured summaries (What/Why/Where/Learned)
- **Session summary** (`mem_session_summary`): Comprehensive end-of-session summary (Goal/Instructions/Discoveries/Accomplished/Next Steps/Files)

### No Raw Tool-Call Auto-Capture

Engram does not record a firehose of raw tool calls. Raw tool calls (`edit: {file: "foo.go"}`, `bash: {command: "go build"}`) are noisy and pollute FTS5 search. The agent's curated summaries are higher signal, more searchable, and don't bloat the database. Shell history and git provide the raw audit trail.

Since v1.15.3, `mem_save` can also best-effort attach the current user prompt when prompt context was already provided to the same MCP process for the same project/session (typically by `mem_save_prompt`) and `capture_prompt` is not disabled. That is not raw event capture: it stores user intent tied to a curated save, and the save still succeeds if prompt context is missing.

---

## Running as a Service

Without a service supervisor, `engram serve` dies whenever the binary is replaced (e.g. on `brew upgrade engram`) or the host reboots, and autosync stops silently. The templates below restart it automatically. Use `engram cloud status` afterwards to confirm — the `Local daemon:` line should report `running on port 7437`.

### Using systemd (Linux)

1. Move binary to `~/.local/bin` (ensure it's in your `$PATH`)
2. Create directories: `mkdir -p ~/.engram ~/.config/systemd/user`
3. Create `~/.config/systemd/user/engram.service` (see below)
4. `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
5. `systemctl --user enable engram`
6. `systemctl --user start engram`
7. `journalctl --user -u engram -f`

`Restart=on-failure` restarts unexpected failures but not a clean exit when the same Engram instance already owns the port. A different or legacy port owner still causes a startup error. Existing installed units are not changed by this example: manually update `~/.config/systemd/user/engram.service` and run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` to apply the policy.

### Using launchd (macOS)

This is the recommended setup for Homebrew users on macOS. With `KeepAlive=true`, launchd relaunches `engram serve` automatically after `brew upgrade engram` replaces the binary, so autosync survives upgrades.

1. Find your binary path: `which engram` (typically `/opt/homebrew/bin/engram` on Apple Silicon or `/usr/local/bin/engram` on Intel)
2. Create the data dir if missing: `mkdir -p ~/.engram`
3. Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gentleman-programming.engram.plist` with the contents below — replace `<HOME>` with the absolute path of your home directory (`echo $HOME`) and adjust the binary path if `which engram` returned something different
4. Load it: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gentleman-programming.engram.plist`
5. Verify: `launchctl list | grep engram` and `engram cloud status` (the `Local daemon:` line should report `running on port 7437`)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

        <!-- Uncomment and fill these to enable cloud autosync:

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string><HOME>/.engram/serve.err.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

To unload (stop and disable): `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gentleman-programming.engram.plist`. To reload after editing the plist: unload, then load again.

> **Note on `brew upgrade`:** launchd does not expand `$HOME` or `~` inside plist values, which is why the template uses literal absolute paths.

### Using Windows Task Scheduler

Windows Task Scheduler is the native service equivalent on Windows. It restarts `engram serve` on login and after reboots, keeping autosync alive without a third-party service manager.

**Setup steps:**

1. Confirm `engram.exe` is in your `PATH`: open PowerShell and run `Get-Command engram`.
2. Set `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` (and any other cloud vars) as a **user or system environment variable** in System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables. Task Scheduler does not inherit session environment variables, so tokens set in your shell profile or in `$env:...` within a PowerShell session will not be visible to the scheduled task.
3. Create the scheduled task by running the PowerShell snippet below in an elevated terminal (Run as Administrator), or import it manually through the Task Scheduler GUI.
4. Verify: after the next login (or trigger manually), run `engram cloud status` — the `Local daemon:` line should report `running on port 7437`.

```powershell
$action  = New-ScheduledTaskAction `
    -Execute  "powershell.exe" `
    -Argument "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -Command `"Start-Process engram -ArgumentList 'serve' -NoNewWindow`""

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn

$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet `
    -ExecutionTimeLimit (New-TimeSpan -Hours 0) `
    -RestartCount 5 `
    -RestartInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 1) `
    -StartWhenAvailable

Register-ScheduledTask `
    -TaskName    "EngramMemoryServer" `
    -Action      $action `
    -Trigger     $trigger `
    -Settings    $settings `
    -RunLevel    Limited `
    -Description "Engram persistent memory server (engram serve)"
```

> **Environment variables:** `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`, `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER`, `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC`, and `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR` must be set as persistent user or system environment variables (Control Panel → System → Advanced → Environment Variables) so Task Scheduler can read them. Variables you `export` or set with `$env:` in a terminal session are not visible to scheduled tasks.

> **Logs:** To capture stdout/stderr, redirect output in the PowerShell command string, for example: `... -Command "Start-Process engram -ArgumentList 'serve' -NoNewWindow -RedirectStandardOutput '$env:USERPROFILE\.engram\serve.out.log' -RedirectStandardError '$env:USERPROFILE\.engram\serve.err.log'"`. Ensure the log files are opened with UTF-8 encoding (`-Encoding UTF8`) if you post-process them.

> **Stopping the task:** `Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName "EngramMemoryServer"` or `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "EngramMemoryServer" -Confirm:$false` to remove it entirely.

## Design Decisions

1. **Go over TypeScript** — Single binary, cross-platform, no runtime. The initial prototype was TS but was rewritten.
2. **SQLite + FTS5 over vector DB** — FTS5 covers 95% of use cases. No ChromaDB/Pinecone complexity.
3. **Agent-agnostic core** — Go binary is the brain, thin plugins per-agent. Not locked to any agent.
4. **Agent-driven compression** — The agent already has an LLM. No separate compression service.
5. **Privacy at two layers** — Strip in plugin AND store. Defense in depth.
6. **Pure Go SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite)** — No CGO means true cross-platform binary distribution.
7. **No raw tool-call auto-capture** — The agent saves curated summaries; `mem_save` may best-effort capture process-local prompt context tied to that save, but Engram does not ingest raw tool-call firehoses. Shell history and git provide the raw audit trail.
8. **TUI with Bubbletea** — Interactive terminal UI following Gentleman Bubbletea patterns.

## Dashboard templ regeneration

The cloud dashboard uses [templ](https://templ.guide/) for server-side HTML components. Generated `*_templ.go` files are committed alongside their `.templ` sources. If you modify any `.templ` file in `internal/cloud/dashboard/`, you must regenerate the Go output before committing.

### Prerequisite

The templ CLI is registered as a module tool at v0.3.1001; no global PATH install is required. To download module dependencies ahead of time:

```sh
go mod download
```

### Regenerate

```sh
make templ
# or directly:
go tool templ generate -path ./internal/cloud/dashboard
```

The regenerated `components_templ.go`, `layout_templ.go`, and `login_templ.go` must be committed together with the `.templ` source changes. The test `TestTemplGeneratedFilesAreCheckedIn` in `internal/cloud/dashboard/templ_policy_test.go` checks that generated files are present; CI additionally checks regeneration for drift.

**Important**: Always use the pinned version `github.com/a-h/templ v0.3.1001` (already in `go.mod`). Regenerating with a different version produces diff churn in generated output.

---

## Cloud Autosync

Autosync is a background push/pull replication service that keeps your local Engram store in sync with the Engram Cloud server without blocking local writes.

### Enabling Autosync

Autosync is **opt-in**. Set all three environment variables before starting `engram serve` or `engram mcp`:

| Variable                | Required          | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC` | Yes (exact `"1"`) | Enables autosync. Any other value disables it.                          |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`    | Yes               | Bearer token for the cloud server.                                      |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER`   | Yes               | Base URL of the cloud server (e.g. `https://cloud.engram.example.com`). |

Example:

```sh
ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC=1 \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN=your-token \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER=https://cloud.engram.example.com \
engram serve

# Or, for stdio MCP agents:
ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC=1 \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN=your-token \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER=https://cloud.engram.example.com \
engram mcp
```

Missing `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` or `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER` logs an `ERROR` and disables autosync gracefully — `engram serve` or `engram mcp` still starts.

### Autosync Phase Table

| Phase         | Meaning                                | Dashboard Status          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `idle`        | Loop running, no cycle yet             | running                   |
| `pushing`     | Pushing local mutations to cloud       | running                   |
| `pulling`     | Pulling remote mutations               | running                   |
| `healthy`     | Last cycle succeeded                   | healthy                   |
| `push_failed` | Last push failed                       | degraded                  |
| `pull_failed` | Last pull failed                       | degraded                  |
| `backoff`     | Too many consecutive failures; waiting | degraded                  |
| `disabled`    | Paused by `StopForUpgrade`             | degraded (upgrade_paused) |

### Reason Code Table

`reason_code` appears in `Manager.Status().ReasonCode` and is surfaced via `/sync/status`:

| `reason_code`      | Cause                                                   | Resolution                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transport_failed` | Network error, server 5xx, or 404 on mutation endpoints | Check server health and network; if 404, see `server_unsupported` note below |
| `auth_required`    | Bearer token rejected (401)                             | Rotate `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`                                                  |
| `policy_forbidden` | Project access denied (403)                             | Check the server-side `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` policy for the denied project; a managed principal's project grant may also need checking. The client does not expose allowlist contents. |
| `internal_error`   | Panic inside the sync cycle                             | Check logs for stack trace                                                   |
| `upgrade_paused`   | Autosync paused during cloud upgrade (`PhaseDisabled`)  | Call `ResumeAfterUpgrade` or restart                                         |

Note: when the cloud server returns 404 on mutation endpoints, the transport logs `[autosync] cloud mutation endpoint returned 404 (server_unsupported)` and the transport-level `ErrorCode` is `"server_unsupported"`, but the manager surfaces this as `reason_code: transport_failed`.

### Troubleshooting

For a step-by-step recovery guide covering `chunk_id does not match payload content hash`, `session payload directory is required`, and the temporary missing-directory repair helper, see [Engram Cloud Troubleshooting](docs/engram-cloud/troubleshooting.md).

**`transport_failed` with `server_unsupported` in logs**: Older pre-mutation cloud server deployments may not implement `POST /sync/mutations/push` or `GET /sync/mutations/pull`, causing 404 responses from those endpoints. Deploy a server version that includes these routes before enabling `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC=1`. Check logs for the line containing `server_unsupported`.

**Autosync not starting**: Check that `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC` is exactly `"1"` (not `"true"` or `"yes"`), and that both `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` and `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER` are non-empty. The process logs an `[autosync] ERROR` line explaining which variable is missing.

**Local writes still blocked**: Autosync runs in its own goroutine and never holds locks shared with the local write path. If local writes appear blocked, investigate the SQLite store layer, not the autosync manager.

---

## Scheduled Explicit Cloud Sync Wrappers

The wrappers under `tools/` are an **alternative** to native autosync for hosts where you cannot keep `engram serve` running. For each explicitly named project, they run the native autosync order: export/push (`engram sync --cloud --project <project>`), then import/pull (`engram sync --cloud --import --project <project>`). **Choose ONE mode** -- native autosync (recommended) when a daemon is feasible, OR these wrappers for the no-daemon case. Do **not** run both at once. Cloud `--all` is intentionally unsupported; projects are never inferred from cwd or an env var.

### Bash: `tools/cloud-sync-projects.sh`

```sh
./tools/cloud-sync-projects.sh my-project my-other-project
./tools/cloud-sync-projects.sh --log /var/log/engram-cloud-sync.log my-project
```

Exit `0` if every attempted export, import, and log operation succeeded; `1` if any attempted phase or logging operation failed; `2` on usage error. If export fails, that project's import is skipped, matching native autosync; the wrapper records the export failure and continues with later projects. If import fails, it is recorded and makes the aggregate result nonzero. Default durable log `$ENGRAM_DATA_DIR/cloud-sync-projects.log` (`~/.engram` fallback); override `--log` > `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SYNC_LOG` > default. Per-project, per-phase status lines go to both timestamped console and log; command stdout+stderr stays live on the console and is appended to the log. Nothing retried or silenced.

### PowerShell: `tools/cloud-sync-projects.ps1`

```powershell
pwsh ./tools/cloud-sync-projects.ps1 my-project my-other-project
pwsh ./tools/cloud-sync-projects.ps1 -LogPath C:\logs\engram-cloud-sync.log my-project
```

Requires PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`); 5.1 is not supported. Same export-then-import order, skipped-import behavior after an export failure, exit codes, and log defaults as Bash; override `-LogPath` > `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SYNC_LOG` > default.

Both wrapper files are included in every GoReleaser release archive under `tools/`; copy the one for your scheduler host from the extracted archive.

### Inspecting the last failure

`phase=<export|import> FAILURE project=<name> exit=<n>` records the exact exit code from the failing CLI phase:

```sh
grep 'phase=.* FAILURE' "${ENGRAM_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.engram}/cloud-sync-projects.log" | tail -n 5
```

```powershell
# PowerShell 7 ($env:ENGRAM_DATA_DIR or $HOME/.engram fallback)
$d = if ($env:ENGRAM_DATA_DIR) { $env:ENGRAM_DATA_DIR } else { Join-Path $HOME '.engram' }
Select-String 'phase=.* FAILURE' (Join-Path $d 'cloud-sync-projects.log') | Select-Object -Last 5
```

Pass the failing project to [Engram Cloud Troubleshooting](docs/engram-cloud/troubleshooting.md) -- the wrappers record and propagate, not interpret or retry.

## Cloud Sync Audit Log

When project sync is paused and a push is rejected, Engram records an audit entry in `cloud_sync_audit_log`. This gives operators a persistent trail of every rejection event, visible in the admin dashboard under **Admin > Audit Log**.

### Schema

| Column        | Type                      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | SERIAL PK                 | Auto-incrementing row identifier                                            |
| `occurred_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of the rejection event                                            |
| `contributor` | TEXT NOT NULL             | Identity of the caller (from `created_by` field in request, or `"unknown"`) |
| `project`     | TEXT NOT NULL             | Project name that was paused and rejected                                   |
| `action`      | TEXT NOT NULL             | Push type discriminator: `mutation_push` or `chunk_push`                    |
| `outcome`     | TEXT NOT NULL             | Rejection outcome: always `rejected_project_paused` in v1                   |
| `entry_count` | INT DEFAULT 0             | Number of entries in the rejected batch                                     |
| `reason_code` | TEXT                      | Short machine-readable reason code (e.g. `sync-paused`)                     |
| `metadata`    | JSONB                     | Reserved for future structured context; not populated in v1                 |

### Outcome Vocabulary

| Outcome                   | Meaning                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rejected_project_paused` | Push was rejected because the project's sync is paused via the admin sync control |

### Action Discriminator

| Action          | Meaning                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mutation_push` | Rejection occurred on `POST /sync/mutations/push`           |
| `chunk_push`    | Rejection occurred on `POST /sync/push` (legacy chunk push) |

Pull requests (`GET /sync/mutations/pull`) are never gated on pause status and never emit audit entries. Paused projects continue to serve reads to enrolled contributors without restriction.

### Retention and Pruning

There is no automatic retention policy in v1. Audit rows accumulate indefinitely. To prune entries older than 90 days, connect to Postgres and run:

```sql
DELETE FROM cloud_sync_audit_log
WHERE occurred_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

Wrap in a transaction and add a `LIMIT` clause if the table is large:

```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM cloud_sync_audit_log
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM cloud_sync_audit_log
  WHERE occurred_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
  LIMIT 10000
);
COMMIT;
```
