# Engram Cloud Quickstart

**Fastest working setup:** run the compose smoke profile, enroll one project, and sync explicitly.

This page gives one recommended path first. Advanced/authenticated mode follows after.

---

## Recommended Path: Local Smoke (Docker Compose)

### 1) Start cloud runtime + Postgres

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.cloud.yml up -d
```

`docker-compose.cloud.yml` defaults on this branch:
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS=smoke-project`
- cloud endpoint published at `http://127.0.0.1:18080`

### 2) Configure CLI cloud endpoint

```bash
engram cloud config --server http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

### 3) Enroll explicit project

```bash
engram cloud enroll smoke-project
```

### 4) Sync explicitly in cloud mode

```bash
engram sync --cloud --project smoke-project
engram sync --cloud --status --project smoke-project
```

### 5) Verify browser dashboard

Open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:18080/dashboard`

In compose smoke mode, `/dashboard/login` redirects to `/dashboard/` (no bearer login needed).

---

## Existing Project Upgrade Path (recommended)

Use this sequence before first bootstrap for established local projects:

```bash
engram cloud upgrade doctor --project smoke-project
engram cloud upgrade repair --project smoke-project --dry-run
engram cloud upgrade repair --project smoke-project --apply
engram cloud upgrade bootstrap --project smoke-project --resume
engram cloud upgrade status --project smoke-project
```

`engram cloud upgrade rollback` is only available before bootstrap reaches `bootstrap_verified`. It concerns local SQLite/bootstrap state, not the deployed container image. For general release upgrades and rollback expectations, see the [Release Policy](../RELEASE-POLICY.md).

---

## Container Image: Pin, Upgrade, and Roll Back

**Production rule:** deploy a deliberately selected exact image reference. This guide defaults to:

- `ghcr.io/gentleman-programming/engram:v2.0.0`

Do not deploy an untagged reference or `:latest` in production.

For a strict immutable pin, set `ENGRAM_IMAGE` to:

- `ghcr.io/gentleman-programming/engram@sha256:3f08b768aeb30d407d54a56827f8090ab506a8c11f0b346d31b9b52b75e4718a`

This digest identifies the published multi-architecture OCI manifest list (the `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` index), not an architecture-specific child image. Choose one exact reference for each deployment.

### Upgrade or roll back the container

1. Record the running container's effective image reference and the client version:

   ```bash
   docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Image}}' "$(docker compose ps -q cloud)"
   engram version
   ```

   Save the first command's output as the rollback image. Inspecting the running container captures a Compose default or shell override that `.env` alone might not show.

2. Read the selected release and migration notes. Confirm the recorded client version is compatible with the selected Cloud image; its exact image reference is the server release evidence. Then back up relevant state. Migrations can constrain rollback; follow the [Release Policy](../RELEASE-POLICY.md).
3. Set `ENGRAM_IMAGE` to the selected exact image reference in the environment source used by Compose. For the `.env` layout below, edit `.env` and update or unset any shell-level `ENGRAM_IMAGE`, because shell variables override `.env`.
4. Pull and redeploy only the cloud service:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull cloud
   docker compose up -d cloud
   ```

5. Verify the deployed `/health` endpoint, cloud status, and an enrolled project:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
   engram cloud status
   engram sync --cloud --status --project <project>
   ```

To roll back the container, set the effective `ENGRAM_IMAGE` to the previously recorded image reference, run `docker compose pull cloud` and `docker compose up -d cloud`, then repeat the verification checks. `engram cloud upgrade rollback` concerns local SQLite/bootstrap state and is not a container rollback.

Do not build from source for production deploys. Use the published image with Dokploy, Coolify, Portainer, or a VPS.

Reference compose file:
- [docker-compose.ghcr.yml](./docker-compose.ghcr.yml)

Required runtime env vars:
- `ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN`
- `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `ENGRAM_PORT=18080`

Optional runtime env vars:
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_MAX_PUSH_BYTES` (defaults to `8388608`)
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` (required to enable managed-token authentication on `engram cloud serve`, and to run `engram cloud bootstrap admin --issue-token`; see [Managed Users and CLI Bootstrap](#managed-users-and-cli-bootstrap) below)

Dokploy guidance:
1. Create a managed Postgres service.
2. Create an app from image `ghcr.io/gentleman-programming/engram:v2.0.0`.
3. Configure the env vars above (with strong secrets).
4. Expose container port `18080`.
5. Avoid build-from-source mode unless you are actively developing Engram itself.

### VPS / self-hosted Compose

For a plain VPS, put secrets in a `.env` file next to your compose file instead of
hardcoding them into YAML.

Directory layout:

```text
/opt/engram/
  docker-compose.yml
  .env
```

Example `.env`:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_USER=engram
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-strong-postgres-password
POSTGRES_DB=engram_cloud

ENGRAM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/gentleman-programming/engram:v2.0.0
ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL=postgres://engram:replace-with-strong-postgres-password@postgres:5432/engram_cloud?sslmode=disable
ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN=replace-with-long-random-bearer-token
ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN=replace-with-separate-admin-token
ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET=replace-with-32+-byte-random-secret
ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS=engram,gentle-ai
ENGRAM_CLOUD_HOST=0.0.0.0
ENGRAM_CLOUD_MAX_PUSH_BYTES=8388608
ENGRAM_PORT=18080
```

Notes:
- Keep `.env` on the server only. Do not commit it.
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` is the bearer token clients use for authenticated sync.
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` is the dashboard admin token. Use a different secret from `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
- `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET` must be an explicit, non-default strong secret in authenticated mode.
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` is required server-side and should be a comma-separated allowlist.
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_MAX_PUSH_BYTES` optionally raises or lowers the server-side limit for chunk and mutation push request bodies. Omit it to keep the default 8 MiB limit.

## Managed Users and CLI Bootstrap

`engram cloud bootstrap admin` creates the first **managed admin** (a `cloud_principals` row, distinct from the legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`/`ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` env-token model):

```bash
engram cloud bootstrap admin --username alice \
  --grant-project my-project \
  --issue-token first-token
```

- `--grant-project` may repeat; managed principals are deny-by-default (no grants means no sync access for that principal).
- `--issue-token [name]` prints the raw managed token exactly once and requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` to be set to a dedicated secret, separate from `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`.
- Running bootstrap again once a managed admin exists is refused (no silent duplicate admin), and every attempt — accepted or refused — is recorded as a `bootstrap.cli` audit event.
- If the one-time bootstrap token output was lost, use `engram cloud bootstrap recover-token` only when no managed token rows exist. To replace the sole unused, active bootstrap token explicitly, use `engram cloud bootstrap recover-token --revoke-existing`; retry it after another lost output only while the current token remains unused. It refuses used, revoked, ambiguous, or multiple-active-token states and preserves the admin and project grants.

**Managed-token last use:** last use records successful managed bearer-token authentication, including dashboard login, not activity in an existing browser cookie session. Authentication fails closed if usage cannot be persisted. Once a token has authenticated successfully, `recover-token --revoke-existing` cannot replace it; use normal token management instead. Legacy credentials and existing cookie-session behavior are unchanged.

**Runtime authentication:** set `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` (the same secret used at token-issuance time) on the `engram cloud serve` process to enable managed-token authentication — `engram cloud serve` then checks the legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`/`ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` credentials first and resolves other bearer tokens through managed storage, on every `/sync/*`, `/admin/*`, and dashboard-login request. If `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` is not set, the server still starts normally and continues to authenticate only via the legacy env-token credentials. Full details: [DOCS.md — Managed users, tokens, and CLI bootstrap](../../DOCS.md#managed-users-tokens-and-cli-bootstrap).

Reference compose:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    volumes:
      - engram-cloud-pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  cloud:
    image: ${ENGRAM_IMAGE:-ghcr.io/gentleman-programming/engram:v2.0.0}
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "18080:18080"
```

For initial startup after creating `.env`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For image changes, follow [Container Image: Pin, Upgrade, and Roll Back](#container-image-pin-upgrade-and-roll-back). Do not use `docker compose restart cloud`; it does not recreate the service with a changed image reference.

Before exposing this deployment to users, complete the [Production Checklist](./production-checklist.md). The Compose example is a starting point, not a complete production platform.

### Client-side token setup

On the machine that runs the Engram CLI, set the client token in the shell before
cloud sync:

```bash
engram cloud config --server https://your-host:18080
export ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN=replace-with-long-random-bearer-token
engram cloud enroll my-project
engram sync --cloud --project my-project
```

> `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` is for local/dev smoke only. Never use it in production.

---

## Confirm one prompt source (human-token only)

For an existing local prompt, use its **exact** sync ID and explicitly assert the owner project:

```bash
engram cloud attest-prompt-source --sync-id <exact-sync-id> --owner-project <owner-project>
```

Review the observed session, source inbox, prompt project, sync ID, and live/deleted kind alongside the separately labeled human-asserted owner. Type `yes` to send that tuple; `no`, invalid input, or a missing/ambiguous local preview sends nothing. A configured human bearer token is required; the remote service enforces both project grants. Only a successful remote attestation with a positive ID is recorded locally against the effective validated cloud endpoint. This command does not import, pull, or delete data.

## Common Failure Reasons

| Reason code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `blocked_unenrolled` | Project is not enrolled for cloud replication |
| `auth_required` | Authenticated runtime requires valid token/session |
| `cloud_config_error` | Cloud endpoint config is missing/invalid |
| `policy_forbidden` | Project blocked by cloud policy. Check the server-side `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` policy for the denied project; a managed principal's project grant may also need checking. The client does not expose allowlist contents. |
| `paused` | Project sync paused in cloud control plane |
| `transport_failed` | Cloud transport/network operation failed |

For concrete recovery steps, see [Engram Cloud Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).

<summary><strong>Advanced: Authenticated Source-Run Mode</strong></summary>

Use this when you are running `engram cloud serve` directly (no insecure compose smoke mode):

```bash
ENGRAM_DATABASE_URL="postgres://engram:engram_dev@127.0.0.1:5433/engram_cloud?sslmode=disable" \
ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET="replace-with-32+-byte-random-secret" \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN="your-token" \
ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS="my-project" \
engram cloud serve
```

Then configure the client through an HTTPS TLS-terminating endpoint and set its token:

```bash
engram cloud config --server https://your-tls-proxy:8443
export ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN="your-token"
engram cloud enroll my-project
engram sync --cloud --project my-project
```

Rules that matter:
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` cannot be combined with `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`
- Bearer-token clients require HTTPS, including after redirects. Plain HTTP is supported only for tokenless local/dev smoke mode.
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` is required server-side in both modes
- authenticated mode requires explicit non-default `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`
- `ENGRAM_CLOUD_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=1` remains local/dev only (never production)
