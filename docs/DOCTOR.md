# Engram Doctor

`engram doctor` runs read-only operational diagnostics against the local SQLite store. It detects, explains, and suggests safe next steps; the base diagnostic command does **not** repair data, apply migrations, delete rows, or mutate sync cursors.

## CLI

```bash
engram doctor
engram doctor --json
engram doctor --project engram
engram doctor --check sync_mutation_required_fields
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --plan
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --dry-run
engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --apply
```

Flags:

- `--json` prints the stable diagnostic envelope for agents.
- `--project PROJECT` scopes checks to a normalized project name.
- `--check CODE` runs one registered check and fails loudly for unknown codes.
- `doctor repair` requires `--project`, `--check`, and exactly one mode: `--plan`, `--dry-run`, or `--apply`.

## MCP

Agents can call `mem_doctor` with the same contract as `engram doctor --json`:

```json
{
  "project": "engram",
  "check": "sqlite_lock_contention"
}
```

Both fields are optional. When `project` is omitted, MCP uses the existing read-tool project detection. Unknown explicit projects return the standard structured `unknown_project` error.

## JSON envelope

The CLI `--json` and MCP tool return:

```json
{
  "status": "ok|warning|blocked|error",
  "project": "engram",
  "summary": { "total": 4, "ok": 4, "warnings": 0, "blocked": 0, "errors": 0 },
  "checks": [
    {
      "check_id": "sqlite_lock_contention",
      "result": "ok|warning|blocked|error",
      "severity": "info|warning|blocking|error",
      "reason_code": "stable_reason_code",
      "evidence": {},
      "safe_next_step": "No action required.",
      "requires_confirmation": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## MVP check catalog

- `session_project_directory_mismatch` — warns when `sessions.project` disagrees with the project inferred from trusted repository evidence for the session directory. The MVP trusts `git_remote` and `git_root` only; it ignores basename fallback, ambiguous workspaces, missing directories, and child-repo auto-promotion to avoid noisy false positives.
- `manual_session_name_project_mismatch` — warns when a `manual-save-{suffix}` session name disagrees with its persisted project. A name alone never establishes `project_owned` ownership.
- `sync_mutation_required_fields` — blocks when a pending `sync_mutations.payload` is missing required fields. On a device that uses cloud sync (at least one project enrolled), it also blocks when pending cloud mutations belong to a project that is not enrolled; the finding identifies the project and backlog count, so enroll intended projects with `engram cloud enroll <project>` or review enrollment before retrying. A local-only install with no enrolled project never reports that finding: the store journals mutations unconditionally, so a non-enrolled backlog is its normal steady state.
- `orphaned_observation_session` — warns when active or soft-deleted observations reference a missing session. Findings are grouped by the stored observation project and session ID. The canonical session cannot be reconstructed automatically, so inspect and recover the data deliberately; no supported repair exists.
- `unowned_session_project` — warns for each session with an unclassified or invalid ownership mode, including blank persisted projects and contradictory legacy manual-save identities. Doctor never guesses a rescue. Use `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> --session <id>` only after review; its apply path creates a SQLite backup that can be restored for rollback. The listing is deliberately unscoped.
- Session modes are `shared` and `project_owned`. Runtime and HTTP-created sessions default to `shared`; deterministic CLI and MCP manual-save sessions are `project_owned`. Shared sync can use old peers. Project-owned sync requires a mode-capable manifest (version 2); returning to an older manifest after project-owned sessions exist is unsupported and fails loudly.
- `sqlite_lock_contention` — warns on conservative SQLite contention signals; returns an error if lock state cannot be evaluated.

## Safety

Plain `engram doctor` remains diagnostic-only. Findings that imply data movement set `requires_confirmation=true` so agents know a human must review evidence before repair.

`engram doctor repair` is intentionally narrow and local-first: local SQLite remains the source of truth. Project reclassification supports:

- `session_project_directory_mismatch`, using trusted `git_remote` or `git_root` evidence from doctor findings.
- `manual_session_name_project_mismatch`, only for exact `manual-save-{known_project}` sessions, and only when trusted directory evidence does not contradict the manual-name target.

Title restoration supports `sync_mutation_required_fields` only when a pending observation upsert has a blank title as its sole missing field and the matching local titleless observation has non-empty content. It derives a sanitized, bounded title from that local content and updates `observations.title` and `sync_mutations.payload` in place; all other invalid mutations remain quarantined on `--apply`.

Repair never deletes or deduplicates rows, never edits sync cursors, and never writes cloud state. `--plan` and `--dry-run` are non-mutating. `--apply` creates a SQLite backup under `<ENGRAM_DATA_DIR>/backups/` before a project reclassification transaction updates only:

- `sessions.project`
- `sessions.ownership_mode` (`project_owned` for a session named `manual-save-{target_project}`, otherwise `shared`)
- `observations.project`
- `user_prompts.project`

Title restoration does not create a SQLite backup.

`orphaned_observation_session` is report-only and is not supported by `engram doctor repair`.

### Repair JSON envelope

All repair modes print stable JSON to stdout:

For `sync_mutation_required_fields`, `repairs` lists title-only observation upserts that can be restored in place; `actions` continues to list residual rows quarantined on `--apply`.

```json
{
  "project": "sias-app",
  "check": "session_project_directory_mismatch",
  "mode": "plan|dry_run|apply",
  "status": "planned|dry_run|applied|noop",
  "actions": [
    {
      "session_id": "session-id",
      "from_project": "sias-app",
      "to_project": "engram",
      "reason_code": "session_project_directory_mismatch",
      "evidence_source": "git_remote"
    }
  ],
  "skipped": [],
  "counts": {
    "sessions_planned": 1,
    "observations_planned": 2,
    "prompts_planned": 1,
    "sessions_applied": 0,
    "observations_applied": 0,
    "prompts_applied": 0
  },
  "backup_path": ""
}
```

On `--apply`, `backup_path` contains the backup database path and `*_applied` counts report the rows updated.

### Clone-safe verification workflow

Never experiment on production `~/.engram/engram.db`. Use a SQLite backup clone or a temporary `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR`:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/engram-repair-clone
sqlite3 ~/.engram/engram.db ".backup '/tmp/engram-repair-clone/engram.db'"
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor --json --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --plan
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --dry-run
ENGRAM_DATA_DIR=/tmp/engram-repair-clone engram doctor repair --project sias-app --check session_project_directory_mismatch --apply
```

After a project reclassification apply, verify each planned session's `project` and `ownership_mode` classification, the related observation and prompt projects, and that `backup_path` exists. If the repair is wrong, stop Engram processes and restore the `backup_path` database file manually.
