# Release Channels and Support Policy

This policy is the canonical source for choosing an Engram release and planning an upgrade or rollback.

## Choose a release channel

| Channel | Intended use | Security support | Production guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latest stable | General and production use | Receives security fixes | Recommended for production |
| Release candidate (RC) | Prerelease validation and feedback | Not guaranteed | Not universally suitable for production |
| Older release | Legacy or temporary compatibility needs | Does not receive security fixes | Upgrade to the latest stable release when practical |

Release candidates may expose functionality not yet available in the latest stable release. Operators who need that functionality accept prerelease risk, including the absence of guaranteed security support and universal production suitability.

## Upgrade deliberately

Before upgrading:

1. Choose the release channel deliberately.
2. Read the release notes and any migration notes for the target release.
3. Back up relevant state and configuration.
4. Validate compatibility with your environment and integrations.
5. Retain a known-good installation or artifact until the upgrade is accepted.

## Rollback expectations

Rollback means restoring the known-good release and configuration, plus any required backup, using the documented procedure for the affected component. It does not promise an automated rollback path or behavior beyond that component's documentation. Feature or data migrations can constrain rollback; consult the release-specific notes before upgrading.

## Check release lag

The [stable release gap audit](../.github/workflows/release-gap-audit.yml) runs weekly and can be dispatched manually. It compares npm's `gentle-engram/latest` to the matching `pi-v*` tag and the latest stable GitHub Release to its `v*` tag. Changes on `main` to Pi plugin or Go runtime/build inputs after those tags produce a failing run and an actionable step summary. Documentation-only changes do not trigger a gap. Path changes are only a signal to review release need; they do not identify fixes or guarantee an artifact is broken. Unavailable metadata or missing tags fail the run rather than implying the channel is current. Maintainers should inspect the summary and changes, decide whether publication is appropriate, and use the existing tag-driven release workflows; the audit never publishes or edits issues.

The Pi npm publish workflow also supports manual dispatch, but it only publishes when the selected GitHub ref is the full `refs/tags/pi-v<package version>` tag matching `plugin/pi/package.json`. Select that tag for a manual run: dispatching from a branch, even one named `pi-v<package version>`, fails the release preflight.
